**🛢️ GOE Regulatory Monitor — Project Summary**

This is a Python-based system that scrapes and tracks regulatory websites across all 50 U.S. states for oil, gas, energy, air, water, and environmental compliance.

### ✅ Core Components

* `scraper.py`: CLI tool to check URLs for content changes using SHA256 hashes and export results (`json`, `csv`, `markdown`).
* `api.py`: FastAPI web server providing REST endpoints for use by external systems or Custom GPTs.
* `state_urls.json`: JSON config listing all regulatory URLs per state, with support for `tags` and `type`.

### ✅ Features Implemented

* Detects content changes per URL (via hash diff).
* Caches results per URL in `.cache/`.
* Stores per-state results in `results/state/{State}/...`.
* Supports:

  * `--state`, `--url`, `--export`, `--only-updated`
  * `--filter-tag`, `--exclude-tag`
* Tags automatically extracted and can be filtered.
* Git-commit-based baseline script: `baseline_commit_all.sh`
* FastAPI endpoints:

  * `/api/check`: Filter by state, tag, or URL
  * `/batch-check`: Bulk check URLs
  * `/api/tags`: List all unique tags
  * `/`: Health check
* OpenAPI 3.1.0 spec defined in `openapi/openapi.yaml` — compatible with OpenAI Custom GPT Actions.
* Markdown usage files and `README.md` explain full structure and usage.
* Optional Docker/Docker Compose setup.

### 🔧 Development Notes

* You can run a full baseline, one state at a time, using `baseline_commit_all.sh --full`.
* You can clean the baseline using `cleanup.sh` before restarting.
* Content + diff files are saved in `results/state/<State>/content/` and `/diff/`.
* Tag filtering applies to both CLI and API.
