      "voiceover": "Under the hood, this system uses a combination of Python-based scrapers and a live API to monitor hundreds of URLs — from air quality boards to energy commissions. Each change is hashed, diffed, and exported in real time — with tags like air, permits, pipeline, or waste — making it searchable and reportable. And with our custom GPT assistant, you can ask questions like: 'What regulatory sites in Texas changed this week?' or 'List all updates related to water in California.' All powered by live data from your own deployment."
