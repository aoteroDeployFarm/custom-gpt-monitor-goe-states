### 🟦 **Slide 1: Title Slide — “Regulatory Monitor GPT”**

**Speaker Notes:**

> Welcome to this introduction to **Regulatory Monitor GPT** — our AI-powered system for monitoring and managing regulatory updates across the energy, oil, and gas sectors in all 50 U.S. states.
>
> This project blends modern scraping, tagging, and GPT integration into a unified solution that gives your teams real-time visibility into compliance changes.

---

### 🟦 **Slide 2: The Problem**

**Speaker Notes:**

> Every state has its own environmental and energy regulatory agencies — and they all post updates differently.
>
> Tracking changes manually means visiting dozens of websites, reading dense content, and hoping nothing slips through the cracks.
>
> It's time-consuming, risky, and frankly, outdated. That’s the problem we set out to solve.

---

### 🟦 **Slide 3: Our Solution**

**Speaker Notes:**

> **Regulatory Monitor GPT** automatically scrapes regulatory websites, tracks content changes, tags them by topic, and makes them accessible via a custom GPT or API.
>
> You can ask questions like:
> *“What’s new in California’s pipeline safety rules?”*
> Or get summaries of every air or water-related update across the U.S. — instantly.

---

### 🟦 **Slide 4: How It Works (Architecture Overview)**

**Speaker Notes:**

> Here's how it all comes together.
>
> First, we maintain a curated list of URLs for each state. Our scraper engine checks each one on a schedule, extracts the meaningful content, and uses a **SHA256 hash** to detect any changes.
>
> Updated content is saved and diffed. Then it's exported and passed through an API that connects to our **GPT**. This makes it possible to ask high-level questions and get accurate, filtered answers — all powered by your live data.

---

### 🟦 **Slide 5: Intelligent Tagging**

**Speaker Notes:**

> Every site and every update is tagged by topic: `air`, `permits`, `water`, `waste`, `pipeline`, and more.
>
> These tags allow both developers and non-technical teams to filter results and focus only on what matters.
>
> For example, a compliance manager might only care about *air quality*, while another team wants *pipeline safety*. We support both with flexible tagging.

---

### 🟦 **Slide 6: Live API & Custom GPT**

**Speaker Notes:**

> This system is GPT-native. We’ve built a fully documented OpenAPI spec and integrated it into a **Custom GPT**, so you can ask real-time questions directly from ChatGPT.
>
> It’s like having a regulatory analyst on call — one that never sleeps, never forgets, and reads *every* update from *every* agency.
>
> This is especially powerful for internal teams that want compliance insights without learning complex CLI tools.

---

### 🟦 **Slide 7: Results & Exports**

**Speaker Notes:**

> The results are clean, exportable, and easy to audit.
>
> Every check is stored as a timestamped file — in `JSON`, `CSV`, or `Markdown`.
>
> You can track updates per state, view diffs, or build dashboards based on structured data.

---

### 🟦 **Slide 8: Automation & Deployment**

**Speaker Notes:**

> The system runs automatically — via cron, GitHub Actions, or your preferred scheduler.
>
> It's lightweight, built in Python, and deployable via Docker.
>
> You can run it locally, in the cloud, or connect it to Render, Railway, or your internal environment.

---

### 🟦 **Slide 9: Alerts & Notifications (Optional)**

**Speaker Notes:**

> We’re also working on alerting features — Slack, email, and webhooks — so you can notify your teams the moment something changes.
>
> For example, get a Slack message when new drilling rules are posted in New Mexico — with the diff attached.

---

### 🟦 **Slide 10: Use Cases**

**Speaker Notes:**

> This is built for compliance, policy, and legal teams who are tired of tracking regulations manually.
>
> Whether you’re at a major energy company or a local permitting agency, this tool helps you stay proactive — not reactive.
>
> It's also great for developers and data teams who want to plug regulatory signals into dashboards or data pipelines.
