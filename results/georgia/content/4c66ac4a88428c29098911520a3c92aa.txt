National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES)Any point source that discharges or intends to discharge to waters of the State must obtain a National Pollutant DischargeStock photo 2_0.jpgElimination System (NPDES) permit. A “point source” is defined as any discernible, confined, and discrete conveyance, including but not limited to, any pipe, ditch, channel, concentrated animal feeding operation, or well (40 CFR 122.2).
