Federal Consistency

The national Coastal Zone Management Act (CZMA), Section 307, requires federal agency activities and development projects affecting any coastal use or resource to be undertaken in a manner consistent to the maximum extent practicable with the state’s CZM program. Also, activities requiring a federal permit or license, and activities conducted with federal financial assistance, that affect coastal uses and resources (see below: Hawaii List of Federal Permits and Financial Assistance) must be conducted in a manner consistent with the state’s CZM program. The CZMA federal consistency provision ensures that federal agencies cannot act without regard for, or in conflict with, state policies that have been officially incorporated into a state’s CZM program. Federal actions affecting any coastal use or resource must be reviewed by the state CZM program to ensure that proposed activities are consistent with state enforceable policies. The federal consistency procedures and requirements are established in the Code of Federal Regulations, 15 CFR 930.
