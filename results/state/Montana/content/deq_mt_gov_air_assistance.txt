Registered sources in Montana include oil and gas facilities, crushers and screens, concrete batch plants, and asphalt plants. All other industry would fall under our permitting program. Click below to find more information about existing permitting and registration sources, including what to do if a change of ownership occurs, how to enter annual emission inventory, and how to meet compliance requirements.Permitted SourcesIntroductionAny source with the potential to emit regulated pollutants above the following threshold levels is required to submit an application:Any source emitting more than 5 ton/year of lead (Pb) or 25 tons/year or any other pollutant; ORAn incinerator of any kindAny source with the potential to emit regulated pollutants above the following threshold levels is required to submit a Title V permit application.A source that has the Potential To Emit (PTE)>100 tpy of any criteria pollutant, which include sulfur dioxide, oxides of nitrogen, volatile organic compounds, particulate matter 2.5, particulate matter 10 , carbon monoxidePTE>10 tpy of any individual hazardous air pollutant (HAP) orPTE>25 tpy of combined HAPsWhen required by other applicable regulations (For example, NSPS or MACT).Montana Air Quality Permits(MAQPs)Some general guidance for minor source operation is described below.If you have questions, please call 406-444-3490Do I need to renew permit?A valid Montana Air Quality Permit (MAQP) does not expire. However, preconstruction permitting approval associated with a specific project generally expires if commencement of construction or contractual obligations that would constitute a substantial loss associated with the project has not occurred within 3 years. A facility requiring an MAQP will generally require modification of that MAQP for any new or modified emitting unit(s) or emissions increase(s) which do not qualify as a de minims change as provided by the Administrative Rules of Montana (ARM) 17.8.745.The Department may revoke an MAQP or any portion of an MAQP in accordance with ARM 17.8.763 upon written request of the permittee, or for a violation of any requirements of the Clean Air Act of Montana, rules adopted under that Act, or any applicable requirement contained in the Montana State Implementation Plan.What do I need to do if I make changes to my permitted facility?A facility must apply for a modification to their existing MAQP for changes not covered by the de minimis permitting exclusion provided by the Administrative Rules of Montana (ARM) 17.8.745. In most cases, changes allowed by the de minimis rule requires a minimum 10-day notification to the Department prior to the change, and must provide specific information required by the rule including information necessary to determine the change in potential to emit of the facility. The Department strives to provide written response to a written proposal of applicability of the de minimis permitting exclusion upon request. Contact the Department for further information at 406.444.3490.To apply for a modification to your existing MAQP, utilize the application forms available here and submit to :DEQ-ARMB-Admin@mt.govWhat do I need to do if a facility with a Montana Air Quality Permit changes owner/operator?The Administrative Rules of Montana (ARM) 17.8.765 provides that a Montana Air Quality Permit (MAQP) may be transferred from one owner or operator to another if the Department receives written notice of intent to transfer, including the names and authorized signatures of the transferor and transferee. The Department has developed anIntent to Transfer Ownershipform which may help administrate this. A request to transfer ownership can be submitted toDEQ-ARMB-Admin@mt.gov.Do I need to submit an emissions inventory?Yes. Annual emissions data can be submitted via the Air Emission Inventory Entry SystemAn Instruction Manual is availablehere.Data entry can be completedhere.Are there any fees associated with my facility?Yes. In addition to application fees, the Department also requires annual operation fees. Operation fees are collected on an annual basis based on the emissions submit to the Air Emissions Inventory Entry System.How to prepare for source testing and reporting?Facilities preparing to conduct a source test or submit test results must following the Montana Source Test Protocol and Procedures Manual (MSTPPM). A source test protocol may be submitted according to the MSTPPM or it may use the alternative source test protocol worksheet and supplement (when testing more than one emission unit). An example of a completed worksheet is available. Source test reports must follow the requirements of the MSTPPM.Source Test Protocol WorksheetSource Test Protocol 3-page SupplementSource Test Protocol ExampleMontana Source Test Protocol and Procedures ManualTitle V SourcesSome general guidance for Title V sources is described below.If you have questions, please call 406-444-3490What is a Title V Operating Permit?Title V of the Clean Air Act requires ‘major sources’ of air pollutants and certain other sources to obtain and operate in compliance with a Title V Operating Permit.A major source with respect to Title V is a source above that emits above the major source thresholds:Emits over 100 tons per year of any criteria pollutant;Emits over 10 tons per year of a single HAP; orEmits over 25 tons per year of any combination of HAPs.These facilities are subject to and the associated operating permits are issued pursuant to the Administrative Rules of Montana Title 17, Chapter 8, Subchapter 12 (ARM 17.8.12).Once you have a Title V PermitThe goal of a TV Operating Permit is to serve as a single document that contains all the applicable requirements associated with the source. The Operating Permit contains permit limits, monitoring, recordkeeping and reporting requirements that are designed to make sure the source knows when it is or isn’t in compliance with air quality regulations.Operating permits require annual certifications that the source is complying with all applicable requirements. Additionally, permits must be renewed every 5 years.When do I need to make a change to my Title V Permit?Title V Operating Permits can be updated. Most changes that require revision to a Montana Air Quality Permit will require revision to the Title V. See theWhat do I need to do if I make changes to my permitted facility?section regarding the MAQP.There are different types of modifications. These include minor modifications, significant modifications, and administrative amendments. Please call 406-444-3490 to discuss your specific situation.What do I need to do if I sell my facility?Complete theIntent to Transfer Ownershipform and submit toDEQ-ARMB-Admin@mt.govWhat is a Responsible Official?The Responsible Official (RO) has the duty to verify and document that the information submitted is compliant with all applicable requirements in the Operating Permit. The RO can be a corporate officer (a person in charge of a principal business function such as a president, vice president, secretary or treasurer, or any other person who performs similar policy or decision-making functions for the corporation) or their duly authorized representative as approved by the Department, who is responsible for the overall operation of the permitted facility and either supervises 250 or more persons or is in charge of $25 million or more in sales or expenditures.The RO signs as a representative of the corporation, but may be individually liable under environmental criminal provisions.What is required if a change in Responsible Official occurs/is requested?Please notify the Department of the new Responsible Official, including name of the Responsible Official, Title, how the person qualifies as a Responsible Official, and contact information including phone number, mailing address, and email. Please also clearly request an Administrative Amendment to your Title V to initiate the Title V being updated to reflect the new Responsible Official in the permit. The Title V permit need only list the Responsible Official’s name. This submission needs to be signed by the new Responsible Official.Do I need to renew my permit?Yes. Title V permits expire every 5 years. Your Title V expiration date should be reflected on the first page of your permit (the first page following the cover letter). A Title V renewal is a separate and distinct requirement from other permit actions such as administrative amendments, minor modifications, and significant modifications. Title V expiration dates are extended only through a renewal action. A complete Title V renewal application is due no less than 6 months prior to your Title V expiration date.If your permit has already expired, you may be covered under an application shield.

As an example, if a facility released 100 tons of the listed air pollutants during 2018, the amount owed would be 100 x $44.35 ($4,435) plus the annual fee of $900 for a total of $5,335.Registered oil and gas facilities pay an annual fee of $850 with no additional per ton fee.Unregistered portable facilities pay an annual fee of $800 with no additional per ton fee.Registered portable facility fees are based on the total tons or cubic yards produced annually with a minimum $500 and a maximum of $13,000.What authority does the Department of Environmental Quality rely on to collect air quality operating fees?75-2-220, Montana Code Annotated (MCA), andAdministrative Rules of Montana (ARM) 17.8.505How are the collected fees used?The fees collected are used to cover the costs of developing, implementing, and administering air quality permitting and registration requirements.Which facilities are required to pay air quality fees?A facility that held a permit or registration after March 1 is required to pay fees for that calendar year. Fees will be assessed the following November.Regulated sources that revoked their permit or deregisterd a facility, but that did so after March 1 are still subject to the prior calendar year fee assessment.Applying the formula given and using the amounts listed on my bill, my calculated total amount does not match with the amount shown on the bill.   Why did that happen?The bill displays only two decimal points for the tons of emissions, however, the amount used in the calculation uses the amount of emissions out to four decimal points. As an example, in one case last year, the bill showed 40.50 tons of emissions but the amount used in the calculation was 40.5021 resulting in a difference of 8 cents in the amount the facility was charged. In another instance, the bill showed 0 (zero) pounds of emissions but using 4 decimal places in the calculation resulted in a charge.How do I submit a payment?A payment coupon is enclosed with your bill.You have several options available for submitting your payment:online by credit card, debit card, or e-check at:https://deq.mt.gov/indexScroll to middle of page and click on "Pay a Bill"by mailing a check to:DEQ, Financial Services Office - PO Box 200901  -  Helena, MT 59620-0901I don't see the answer to my question here, who do I contact?You may call the Air Quality Bureau at the Montana Department of Environmental Quality at(406) 444-3490orSend an email to:Air Quality Support ServicesorWrite to us:Montana DEQ - Air, Energy and Mining Division - Air Quality Bureau - PO Box 200901 - Helena, MT 59620-0901
