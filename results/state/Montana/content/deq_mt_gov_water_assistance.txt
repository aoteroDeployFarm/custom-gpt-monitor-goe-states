Groundwater is also important for irrigation, livestock, and indirectly for thermoelectric power. Montana’s programs for the protection and remediation of groundwater are driven by the need to keep groundwater safe from contamination and to protect and support the current and future uses of groundwaterMontana Groundwater Pollution Control System (MGWPCS) - Groundwater PermitsThe Montana Groundwater Pollution Control System (MGWPCS) program issues groundwater discharge permits to owners of potential sources of pollution to state groundwater. Typical permitted facilities include residential wastewater treatment systems, metal ore mills, lumber mills, wood product manufacturers, breweries, and community water treatment plants.Who Needs a Permit?The Montana Water Quality Act (§75-5-605 ) requires a valid permit for the following activities:(a) construct, modify, or operate a disposal system that discharges into any state waters;(b) construct or use any outlet for the discharge of sewage, industrial wastes, or other wastes into any state waters; or(c) discharge sewage, industrial wastes, or other wastes into any state waters.MGWPCS permits are for discharge to state groundwaters. They are not applicable for discharges occurring within the boundaries of federally recognized Indian Lands. For additional information on discharges occurring within Indian Lands please refer to theUSEPA Underground Injection Control ProgramMGWPCS permits may also not be applicable for discharges located near state surface waters. For additional information on surface water discharge permits, please refer to the Surface Water Discharge (MPDES) program.Applying for a MGWPCS PermitAn individual MGWPCS permit is a stand-alone permit issued for a site-specific activity. Each individual permit may differ as they are based on the specifics of each discharge site and of each proposed discharge activity.Each individual permit is placed into a category based on the type of wastewater to be discharged; either domestic (e.g. sinks, toilets, showers) or non-domestic (industrial or other wastewater). Please apply or renew an individual permit using our online systemFACTS.Guidance DocumentsMGWPCS Program OverviewMontana Nondegradation Policy GuidanceMixing Zone GuidancePermit Maintenance and ModificationsMaintenance of an existing permit is sometimes needed in order to keep the permit up to date with proposed facility or administration changes. A Modifications may be classified as either a minor or major depending on the proposed changes.Major Modifications are typically required when the permittee plans to alter their collection system, treatment facility, or disposal structures (e.g. addition of a discharging structure, increase in design capacity). A modification may not be required when replacing like-for-like equipment, or improving the existing treatment methods.The application procedures for major modification of an individual permit mirrors the administrative procedure in applying for a new permit. For more information, please refer to the Individual Permit Application Information.Minor Modifications are typical when the permittee plans on undergoing minor administrative changes such as transfer of permit ownership. In order to transfer ownership, a complete PTN form, along with a $500 minor modification fee is required.Existing Groundwater PermitsPermit NumberFacility NameNameLocationMTX000002CONTACT MINING COMPANYCONTACT MINING COMPANYPHILIPSBURGMTX000014OT MINING CORPORATIONOT MINING CORPORATIONBASINMTX000052COLSTRIP ENERGY LP ROSEBUD FLYASH DISPOSALCOLSTRIP ENERGY LIMITED PARTNERSHIPCOLSTRIPMTX000061YELLOWSTONE ENERGY LTDYELLOWSTONE ENERGY LIMITED PARTNERSHIPWARRENMTX000092PLUM CREEK MANUFACTURING FACILITYPLUM CREEK COLUMBIA FALLSCOLUMBIA FALLSMTX000094BARRETTS MINERALS INCELEVATION NEWCO, LLCDILLONMTX000097PARADINE MILLPARADINE MILL, INC.RADERSBURGMTX000099ROSEBURG FOREST PRODUCTSROSEBURG FOREST PRODUCTSMISSOULAMTX000100STAMPEDE PACKING COMPANY AKA MEAT PRODUCTION INCSTAMPEDE PACKING COMPANYKALISPELLMTX000102NEW CASTLE COURTLIERG INCMISSOULAMTX000103RAMSHORN VIEW ESTATESRAMSHORN SUBDIVISION OWNERS ASSOCIATIONGALLATIN GATEWAYMTX000105DRH CHICO TENANT LLCCHICO HOT SPRINGSPRAYMTX0001084 DOT MEADOWS SUBDIVISION4 DOT MEADOWS CO WATER AND SEWERBELGRADEMTX000110FOUR CORNERS WATER & SEWER DISTRICT WWTSFOUR CORNERS WATER & SEWER DISTRICTBOZEMANMTX000111WOODY MOUNTAIN SUBDIVISIONTRIPLE TREE INCMISSOULAMTX000112VALLEY GROVE WATER AND SEWERVALLEY GROVE WATER AND SEWER DISTBOZEMANMTX000115BLAINS MOBILE HOME COURTMEADOWLARK CAPITAL LLCBILLINGSMTX000116CITY OF BELGRADECITY OF BELGRADEBELGRADEMTX000118AVALON LIVING INCST.

Each authorization will include conditions that minimize, to the extent practicable, the magnitude of any change in water quality and the length of time during which any change may occur. Some may include site-specific requirements that ensure the activity does not have any long-term impact on existing and beneficial uses of state water.Who Must ApplyAny person, agency, or entity, public or private, initiating construction activity that will cause short-term or temporary violations of state surface water quality standards for turbidity.Activities Requiring a PermitAny activity in any state water that will cause unavoidable short-term violations of water quality standards. “State water” includes any body of water, irrigation system, or drainage system, either surface or underground, including wetlands, except for irrigation water where the water is used up within the irrigation system and the water is not returned to other state water.Application Procedure/TimelineA 318 Authorization must be obtained prior to initiating a project. The authorization may be obtained from DEQ, or may be waived by Montana Fish, Wildlife & Parks during its review process under the Natural Streambed and Land Preservation Act (310 Permit) or the Stream Protection Act (SPA 124 Permit). Under certain circumstances, Montana Fish, Wildlife & Parks can issue 318 permits on behalf of DEQ.Individual applications submitted to DEQ are normally processed within 30 to 60 days. Authorizations waived under the 310 or SPA 124 permit processes correspond to the timeframe under each permit system, usually 30 to 60 days. There is an application fee of $250 (make check or money order payable to Water Protection Bureau, Department of Environmental Quality).Apply for short-term water quality standard for turbidity related construction activity using theJoint Application Formavailable through the Department of Natural Resources & Conservation (DNRC) stream permitting site.Contacts318 Authorization,Keenan Storrar(406) 444-2734FACTS (Fees, Applications, and Compliance Tracking System)FACTS is the Water Protection Bureau’s online system to apply for and manage wastewater and stormwater discharge permits.

These public water systems and their water works operators are the first line of defense against contaminants getting into our water supplies and threatening public health. This section was developed for public water system owners and operators. For consumer information, go toUnderstanding Your Drinking Wateron the Drinking Water program page.Public Water System Inspections (Sanitary Surveys)Compliance and reporting is critical to maintaining both Montana’s public water supply and the health of Montana lakes, rivers, streams and wetlands. DEQ conducts a variety of inspections and requires mandatory reporting to ensure compliance and protection of public health and Montana waters.The purpose of a sanitary survey is to protect public health by ensuring a water system is able to consistently and reliably deliver an adequate quality and quantity of safe drinking water to the consumer and to maintain compliance with regulations.To achieve this, the surveyor will evaluate eight key elements of a water system.Eight Key Elements of a Sanitary Survey:SourceTreatmentDistribution systemFinished water storagePumps, pump facilities, and controlsMonitoring, reporting, and data verificationSystem management and operationOperator compliance with state requirementsIn addition, technical assistance can be provided during the survey visit. This can be an opportunity to clarify proper monitoring and sampling requirements or procedures and be informed of any upcoming changes in regulations.How Often are These Surveys Conducted?Please refer toSanitary Survey Fact Sheetfor information on what to expect and how to prepare for an upcoming sanitary survey.Community Water Systems:At leaste every three yearsNon-Transient Non-Community Water System:At least every five yearsTransient Non-Community Water System:At least every five yearsDrinking Water Monitoring and SamplesThe Public Water Supply Monitoring Schedule informs public water system operators, owners, and administrators on: what they must sample for; the required number of samples to be taken; where and when samples are to be taken; correct label information for the sample bottles and forms; and whether the system has met the current requirement.Public Water Supply Monitoring ScheduleSubmitting Public Water Sample ResultsIndividual system submittals for chlorines, SWTR monthly reports, and miscellaneous system submittals can be emailed to:dpws@mt.govDEQChlorine@mt.govSubmitting Public Water Sample Results - Using Compliance Monitoring Data Portal (CMDP)The Compliance Monitoring Data Portal is a web-based reporting system created by EPA for laboratories reporting drinking water compliance sample results (and soon for public water systems to report operational data) to state primacy agencies.

Participation is voluntary. It is still the responsibility of the PWS to meet their monitoring requirements and DEQ is not responsible for a PWS to maintain compliance. The contact is responsible for associated phone call or text charges, not DEQ.How it WorksReminders will be sent for samples and forms before they are due, generally about 75% through compliance period. For example, total coliform reminders will be targeted for the third week of the month and annual nitrate will be scheduled for the end of the 3rdquarter (September). Each reminder will be sent specific to a rule (Bacteria will be separate from Chlorine, etc.). For contacts who are signed up as contact for multiple PWS, will receive one email with all the PWS that have outstanding forms or samples. Phone messages will leave a voice message if there is no answer and the phone has a voicemail option.Reminders will not be sent for all rules. The rules that reminders will be sent include: RTCR - Monthly and Quarterly Bacteria and Seasonal Startup Form; Monthly Chlorine Sheets; Nitrate; Asbestos; SOC, VOC, IOC; DBP (3-year schedules only); Lead and Copper Sample and Consumer Notice; CCR and CCR Certification Form; Radionuclides; and State-Wide Waiver.How to Sign up or Modify a ContactPlease email the required information todpws@mt.gov.  The required information includes: Contact Name, PWS Name and PWSID, Preferred delivery method phone call, text message, or email, phone number or email address.Reminder contact need not be the operator or administrative contact, it can be anyone the system designates. Contacts that wish to receive reminders for more than one PWS are required to sign up for email reminders only (phone call and text message are not eligible). Each PWS is limited to one phone or text contact and up to five email contacts.FAQI sampled and still received a reminder.It is likely that the lab has not submitted the sample to DEQ. Please call your lab first and ask them to submit the sample to DEQ or contact the DEQ Rule Manager.I signed up for reminders and have not received one yet.If you have been sampling on time it is likely because DEQ has received the samples prior to sending the reminders. You can also confirm the contact information by asking DEQ.I did not receive a reminder and then I received a violation.It is the responsibility of water system to maintain compliance. This reminder service is designed to assist water systems but does not replace their responsibility.Wastewater Treatment System Operator AssistanceWastewater Monitoring and Reporting (NETDMR)Discharge Monitoring and Reporting (DMR) Guidance and Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) Guidance DocumentThe Discharge Monitoring Report (DMR) Guidance and Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) document is intended for the use of water and wastewater permittees and authorized representatives who hold surface or ground water discharge permits that are required to complete, submit, and maintain records of sampling, calculations, Discharge Monitoring Reports (DMRs), and noncompliance reporting for compliance with their MPDES or MGWPCS permit.MT DEQ Compliance GuideMontana Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (MPDES) permits for wastewater treatment require the reporting of discharge monitoring results.
