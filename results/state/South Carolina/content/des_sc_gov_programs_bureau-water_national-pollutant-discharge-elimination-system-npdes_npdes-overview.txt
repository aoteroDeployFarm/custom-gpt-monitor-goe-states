The National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) Permit Program was created by Section 402 of the 1972 FederalClean Water Act. In 1975, the Bureau of Water received authority from the Environmental Protection Act (EPA) to administer the NPDES Permit Program in SC. The Bureau is responsible for the permitting, compliance, monitoring, and enforcement activities of the program.Personswithpoint source dischargesto surface waters are required to have NPDES permits.
