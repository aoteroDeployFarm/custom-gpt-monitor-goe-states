The process is largely paperless, except for the submission of:the permit fee payment;the stamped well plat;a spacing map, if necessary; anda Certification formApplicants have the option to sign and submit the Certification form electronically.One important feature is the applicant's ability to track the review process online. For applicants that commonly file similar types of applications, OGePermit offers the ability to create custom templates. These templates allow the applicant to store common well-based information, including standard casing and cementing data, minimizing data entry for multiple applications.Registrationto Use OGePermitBefore an operator can access and utilize OGePermit, they need to file aRegistration to File Electronic Submission Form (PDF)(90 KB) with DEC. This registration sets up two levels of authorized company representatives. The first level is a Data Entry Group; the Data Entry Group may create applications and save them, but cannot submit them. The second level is a Data Submission Group. The Data Submission Group is a subset of the names listed in Box 7 of theOrganizational Report Form (PDF)(301 KB), that must be on file with the Division. Box 7 identifies those individuals who can submit filings for the company. The Data Submission Group can create and submit applications themselves and/or view, edit and submit the applications created by others in their organization. The Data Submission Group will receive e-mails from the system and can check on the processing of applications.Once DEC receives and approves the Registration to File Electronic Submission Form, staff will create the user name and initial password for the user. After logging in the first time, the user will be prompted to change their password. Additional information on the login process and password selection is available as a separate document, which is provided when DEC approves the registration form. Part of the login and set-up process is the creation of challenge questions. DEC maintains the password as an encrypted file and is unable to tell the applicant the password. The user can query the system for their password through the answering of the challenge questions. Upon request DEC can reset a password, but again, the applicant will need to reset the password on first login.For additional information on the using OGePermit or the application process, please review the linked documents on this page or contact theDivision of Mineral Resources.PaperApplicationsIf an operator is unable to utilize OGePermit, pleasecontact the Divisionabout submitting a paper application.Contact for this PageDMN, Bureau of Oil and Gas Regulation625 BroadwayAlbany,NY12233Phone:518-402-8056[emailÂ protected]This Page CoversNew York StateIcon
