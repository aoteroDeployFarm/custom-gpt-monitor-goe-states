Natural GasNYS Pipeline Safety ProgramOn this pageOn this pageNYS Pipeline Safety ProgramAbout the ProgramThe New York State Public Service Commission through its pipeline safety program develops and enforces safety standards for natural gas, hazardous liquid, and steam distribution pipelines located within the state. The program also inspects portions of interstate natural gas and hazardous liquid pipelines located within New York State on behalf of the federal Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) under an Interstate Agency Agreement with the USDOT. Although DPS conducts the inspections of interstate pipeline located within the state, PHMSA sets the minimum safety standards and retains all enforcement authority with respect to interstate pipeline companies.Program Manager: Kevin Speicher[email protected]Phone: 518-474-5453Fax: 518-473-56253 Empire State PlazaAlbany, NY 12223Regulated Pipeline CompaniesDPS conducts audits and inspections of regulated pipeline companies to evaluate compliance with Federal and State Pipeline Safety Regulations.

Regulations have not yet been repealed.Historical Note: Part 260 contained regulations related to Synthetic Gas Plants (Manufactured Gas).NYS Siting Process for PipelinesThe siting of major pipelines used in intrastate commerce purposes in New York State is through an Article VII proceeding. Please seeArticle VII Major Electric and Gas Transmission Facilitiesfor more information on this process. Siting and routing for pipelines used for interstate commerce purposes is performed underFederal Energy Regulatory Commission’sjurisdiction.Within NYS, Gas Corporations are entities that own and operate gas plant (e.g., any facility to be used for the manufacture, conveying, transportation, distribution, sale or furnishing of gas (natural or manufactured or mixture of both) for light, heat or power). Pursuant to Public Service Law §68, no gas corporation shall begin construction of gas plant without first having obtained the permission and approval of the commission. The process of obtaining this permission is referred to as Section 68 Proceeding and leads to the granting of a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity (CPCN). Once granted, pipeline company may begin construction and operation within the limitations of the CPCN, which generally includes authority to construct pipelines not covered under the Article VII process.Key Pipeline Safety Program Staff[email protected]DPS staff email format:[email protected]Phone: 518-474-5453, Fax: 518-473-56253 Empire State PlazaAlbany, NY 12223DownstateUtility Supervisor –Suresh ThomasNYC - Long Island Office– Field Supervisor: Arpit MehtaCompanies: National Grid - NYC and Long IslandCounties: Kings, Queens, Richmond, Nassau, SuffolkNYC - Lower Hudson Office– Field Supervisor: Jonathan MercurioCompanies: Consolidated Edison and Orange & Rockland UtilitiesCounties: New York, Bronx, Queens, Orange, Rockland, WestchesterUpstate - Western RegionUtility Supervisor –Brett MahanSyracuse Office– Field Supervisor: Kimberly GuzzoCounties: Chemung, Chenango, Cortland, Delaware, Franklin, Herkimer, Jefferson, Lewis, Livingston, Madison, Oneida, Onondaga, Ontario, Oswego, Otsego, Seneca, St. Lawrence, Schuyler, Steuben, Tioga, Tompkins, Wayne, YatesBuffalo Office– Field Supervisor: Kristi FogleCounties: Allegany, Broome, Cattaraugus, Cayuga, Chautauqua, Erie, Genesee, Monroe, Niagara, Orleans, WyomingUpstate - Eastern RegionUtility Supervisor -Michael MollAlbany Office– Field Supervisor: Steven DiLilloCounties: Albany, Clinton, Columbia, Fulton, Hamilton, Montgomery, Putnam, Rensselaer, Saratoga, Schenectady, Schoharie, Sullivan, Ulster, Warren, Washington, EssexMain Office - Damage Prevention Enforcement- Supervisor: Michael PasinellaMain Office - Pipeline Safety Code Enforcement- Supervisor: Valerica OreifejNYS Pipeline Emergency Response Initiative (NYSPERI)The NYS Pipeline Emergency Response Initiative advances the ability of New York State’s emergency responders to manage pipeline emergencies through improved training, cooperation and communication with pipeline operators.GPERI PresentationDownloadGPERI April 2014DownloadRelated Pipeline Safety LinksGas Leak Detection Instruments and DevicesNYS Pipeline Safety Reports and OrdersPHMSA Advisory BulletinsPipeline Safety InspectionsFind Who’s Operating Pipelines in Your AreaNational Pipeline Mapping SystemPHMSA Pipeline Safety Program Data for New York State
