ImageThe MPCA regulates the design, construction, and operation of treatment facilities for municipal and industrial wastewater in Minnesota. Any industrial facility, municipality, or private entity that proposes to discharge a specified amount of a pollutant into surface or ground waters of the state must apply for a permit.MPCA water quality permits establish specific limits and requirements to protect the quality of Minnesota's surface and groundwater. Permits are regularly reviewed and updated as they expire, allowing the MPCA to incorporate new information about the impacts of pollutants to the environment in subsequent permits. Permits are enforced through a combination of self-reporting (to the MPCA, U.S. EPA, or both) and compliance monitoring.GovDelivery: OnPoint MNPCA_150Stay connectedSubscribe to the OnPoint newsletter for updates and information for wastewater permit holders.SubscribeTypes of permitsThe MPCA is authorized to issue both NPDES/SDS and SDS permits, both of which can be either an individual or general permit.NPDES/SDS— National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) is a federal program established under the Clean Water Act.
