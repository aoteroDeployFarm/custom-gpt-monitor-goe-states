There are five basic principles:The 45-day review period begins the day after the proposed permit is submitted to the EPA for review;The 60-day petition period begins the day after the end date of EPA’s review period;Count every day, including weekends and federal holidays (start dates can fall on a weekend or holiday);If the end date of EPA’s 45-day review period falls on a weekend or federal holiday, the 45-day review period’s end date rolls over to the next business day. As a result, the 60-day petition period will begin the day after that next business day.If the 60-day petition period ends on a weekend or federal holiday, the petition period’s deadline is rolled over to the next business day.For information on the status of a specific Title V permit submitted to Region 5 by Minnesota MPCA, contact one of the EPA’s contacts.MinnesotaNational Supporting ResourcesCAA Permitting HomeNew Source Review (NSR) ProgramTitle V ProgramTribal Permit ProgramOuter Continental ​Shelf Permit ProgramCAA Permitting Tools & ​Related ResourcesAir Permitting TermsWhere You LiveAir Permitting Policy & GuidanceSearch DocumentsNSR Policy & GuidanceTitle V Policy & GuidanceTitle V Petition DatabaseRegion 5 CAA Permitting FocusRegion 5 MainState-Issued PermitsEPA-Issued PermitsRegion 5 Tribal PermittingPermitting Under the Clean Air ActOpen Sidenav MenuClose Sidenav MenuClean Air Act Permitting Around the Nationexpand or collapse the child menuNew England Region (R1)New York, New Jersey, Puerto Rico and U.S. Virgin Islands (R2)Mid-Atlantic Region (R3)Southeastern Region (R4)Great Lakes Region (R5)South Central Region (R6)Midwest Region (R7)Mountains and Plains Region (R8)Pacific Southwest Region (R9)expand or collapse the child menuAir Permit Delegation and PSD SIP ApprovalElectronic Permit System and DashboardsPending and Issued PermitsAbout NSR PermittingAbout OCS PermittingAbout PSD PermittingAbout Title V PermittingPermitting in ArizonaPermitting in CaliforniaPermitting in Hawai'i and Pacific IslandsPermitting in NevadaPacific Northwest Region (R10)CAA Permitting Tools & ​Related ResourcesOuter Continental Shelf Air PermitsContact Us About Permitting Under the Clean Air ActContact Us About Permitting Under the Clean Air Actto ask a question, provide feedback, or report a problem.Last updated on February 19, 2025
