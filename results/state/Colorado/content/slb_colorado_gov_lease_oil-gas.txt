Additionally, all of our lessees are required to follow oursite-specific stewardship stipulations. Violating stewardship stipulations may result in lease termination.TheColorado Energy and Carbon Management Commission (ECMC)is the regulatory agency for oil and gas development in the State of Colorado. The State Land Board is a separate agency from the ECMC. Our agency and our lessees are subject to the same local, state, and federal rules and requirements as any private land owner.*** IMPORTANT ROYALTY PAYMENT INFORMATION ***Oil and gas payers must continue to file the standard royalty production data by the established deadlines.

The state received this acreage at statehood (1876) from the federal government.Today we have 990 active oil and gas leases covering approximately 400,000 acres of mineral estate. These leases resulted in approximately $1.5 billion earned for trust beneficiaries -- Colorado schoolchildren -- in the past 15 years.Yet only 12% are actually produced: 88% of oil and gas leases on trust lands never go into production, i.e. no extraction occurs.View a slideshow about oil and gas development on trust land in Colorado orread a text-only version of the timeline:Obtain a LeaseThe State Land Board offers oil and gas leases by competitive auction.

Watch our short video about why we're proud that oil and gas leasing on trust lands has earned nearly $1.5 billion for Colorado's public schools in the past 15 years:Q&A - general leasingWhat are the oil and gas lease terms?Oil and gas leases are issued at auction for a primary term of five years. An annual rental is applicable for the life of the lease; currently, the rate is $2.50/acre. The Board’s current royalty rate is 1/5th with no deductions allowed for post-production costs.Sixty days prior to the end of the primary term of the lease, a lessee may request an additional one (1) year extension (sixth-year extension) that is at staff discretion; additional one (1) year extensions beyond the sixth-year may be approved by the Board. Lessees should contact the Oil and Gas Specialist at minimum three months prior to the anniversary date of the lease if a lease extension is desired that must be approved by the Board.State Land Board leases require a performance bond, which is separate from the bonding required by the Colorado Energy & Carbon Management Commission (ECMC). State Land Board bonds are required by statute to prevent waste of state trust assets and can cover items such as (but not limited to) surface reclamation, rentals, and royalties. Bonds are required prior to accessing the surface of the property, commencing operations, or any disturbance on the land.State leases do not have a pooling provision. In order to join state trust minerals with other minerals outside the lease (including a second state trust lease), a Communitization Agreement must be approved by the State Land Board. Communitization Agreement Guidelines and the Communitization Agreement form are available under Forms and Instructions.Can I cancel my lease at any time prior to development?Yes. All oil and gas leases have a surrender clause that allows the lessee to surrender all or a portion of the leased land, by paying all amounts due and submitting a written surrender request to the State Land Board.To prevent unwanted rental charges, the State Land Board encourages lessees to notify the agency in writing of a request to surrender a lease. Surrender requests should be emailed to theOil and Gas Specialist, Catie Stitt, prior to the next anniversary date of the lease. Lessees that stop paying rent without providing a proper written surrender request can be charged prorated rent. Prorated rental charges are calculated based on a timeframe that includes the State Land Board’s determination of non-payment of rent, notification period to the lessee for the unpaid rent, and time to cure a default under the terms of the lease.For partial surrenders: only contiguous tracts totaling a minimum of 40 acres in a lease can be surrendered (unless the original lease was for less than 40 acres).If the surrendered lease has been recorded in the county, a Release of Lease or Memorandum of Release must also be recorded in the county when the lease is relinquished and a copy of the recorded Release submitted to the State Land Board for the lease file.Can I assign my lease?Yes. But you need State Land Board approval. For details on the Oil & Gas lease assignment process, please refer to theOil & Gas Lease Assignment Guidelines.What are general and special lease stipulations?All oil and gas leases receive a general stipulation. The general stipulations are provided in the links below for review.Leases may also have a special stipulation depending on whether the lease overlaps with an identified biological or other development concern. For example, if an operator's lease is in the Greater Sage Grouse High Priority Habitat, their lease may also contain a special stipulation geared toward the protection of greater sage grouse. Another example could be if an operator's lease is near a housing development. In that case, their lease may have a special stipulation related to noise or light mitigation.Read more about lease stipulations.What are the bond requirements for state leases?The current bonding requirements for oil and gas leases, disposal wells and surface use agreements were approved by the Board and went into effect April 1, 2016. State Land Board leases require a performance bond, which is separate from the bonding required by the Colorado Energy & Carbon Management Commission (ECMC). State Land Board bonds are required by statute to prevent waste of state trust assets and can cover items such as (but not limited to) surface reclamation, rentals, and royalties. Bonds are required prior to accessing the surface of the property, commencing operations, or any disturbance on the land. Performance bond requirements range from $25,000 per lease to a $100,000 oil and gas activity blanket bond. For details, please refer to theOil & Gas Bonding Information and FAQs.What are the fees associated with Oil & Gas leases?Please see theState Land Board’s Fees & Payment Consideration schedulefor details.What if I want to record my lease in the county office?Most county offices will accept a printed copy.  If not, we can make a certified copy for recording purposes upon request.  Please emailSherry.lee@state.co.usor call 303-866-3454 x3322 for help.Is there a Board Policy to reference?Yes, there is anOil & Gas Development Policyadopted by the Board for this type of leasing.

If a lessee plans to use state trust surface but either 1) does not have the underlying oil and gas lease or 2) is developing the underlying oil and gas lease AND additional acres outside the subject oil and gas lease, a SUA will be required. View ourSurface Use Agreement Document Checklist,Pay Table Calculator, andsample agreement.

If a tract has an active oil and gas lease, we may require written permission from the lessee prior to issuing a seismic permit.What is a Communitization Agreement and do I need one?A Communitization Agreement (also known as a “CA”) is the mechanism through which the State Land Board agrees to pool minerals with minerals outside the subject oil and gas lease (adjoining state trust leases will still require a CA if those leases are pooled together for development).If a lessee is developing a Spacing and Drilling Unit (“DSU”) or has a well that will drain oil and gas from a state lease and additional acres (the well could be on or off state trust lands) a CA should be filed with the State Land Board as APDs are filed or DSU applications are filed with the Colorado Energy & Carbon Management Commission. Check out ourCommunitization Agreement Guidelinesand theCommunitization Agreement form.What is a subsurface easement and do I need one?A subsurface easement allows non-productive oil and gas wellbore to travel through the State Land Board's pore space.  If you are drilling a well and your pipe will enter state trust lands (surface or mineral estate) you should contact our office. The contact for subsurface easements is Catie Stitt, Oil & Gas Specialist:catie.stitt@state.co.usor 303-866-3454 x 3326.Who can I contact for help?For questions or assistance, please contactCatie Stitt, Oil and Gas Manager, at 720-854-3326.Q&A - ownership and split estateDoes the State Land Board keep records of all mineral ownership in Colorado?No. The State Land Board manages a specific set of lands granted to the State of Colorado in 1876 by the Federal Government for the benefit of K-12 education, Universities, and other Public Institutions. The State Land Board only maintains records of minerals managed by the State Land Board. Please see “Who owns the minerals under my house/land?” for additional resources in determining mineral ownership in Colorado.Am I able to locate state mineral ownership online?Yes. The State Land Board owns roughly 4 million mineral acres throughout the state. These lands can be viewed through ourGIS map server.Follow these steps to use the map server to locate state trust minerals:Turn on the mineral ownership layer in the “Layers” box on the right of your screen. Mineral ownership is under “SLB Ownership” and when on, will appear in red dots. From there, to use the map server to identify active oil and gas leases:Turn on “SLB Leases” by clicking in the box. Then click on the “+”, scroll down to Oil & Gas and turn on “Oil and Gas - Active”.Click on the area you are interested in viewing; an “Identify” box will pop up and contain ownership information as well as active oil and gas lease information. If there is no oil and gas lease information, the tract is, most likely, not currently leased. There may be multiple records to click through -- keep an eye out for “Features” on both the Lease tab and Ownership tab that will tell you how many records exist.Or contact Shawn Logan, Planning Specialist, atshawn.logan@state.co.usor 303-866-3454 x3346 for help.The State Land Board owns minerals under my land. What is a No Surface Occupancy (NSO) agreement?The State Land Board owns approximately 1.2 million acres of mineral estate where the surface estate above is owned by another party (“split” or “severed” estate). Under Colorado law, the mineral estate owner is granted rights to access their mineral ownership, even if the surface is owned by another party. Surface owners wanting to ensure that the development of state trust minerals does not result in a surface occupancy on their land may consider obtaining a NSO agreement with the State Land Board. The length of term for a NSO agreement and consideration charge will be determined after the application is received. NSO agreements will not prohibit oil and gas development using horizontal or directional wellbores.View this informational sheet for more information on determining whether the State Land Board owns the minerals under your property.Contact Ben Teschner atbenjamin.teschner@state.co.usor 303-866-3454 x 3313 for additional information on NSO agreements.  The NSO Agreement Application and Assignment forms are available below under “Forms & Instructions.”Who can I contact for help?For questions or assistance, please contactCatie Stitt, Oil and Gas Manager, at 720-854-3326.Q&A - generalAre all minerals available for leasing via online auction?No. Currently the State Land Board only auctions oil and gas leases through online auction, but is considering offering additional mineral leases (such as solid minerals) through this process.I am interested in leasing a mineral other than oil and gas.
