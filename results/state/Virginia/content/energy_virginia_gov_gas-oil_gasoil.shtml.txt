Money for the fund comes from permit surcharges, which must accompany each application for a new permit. Gas and Oil administers the fund and, through a competitive bid process, selects contractors to plug wells and reclaim sites when sufficient funds are available. Orphan well sites are prioritized according to their condition and potential threat to public safety and the environment, and those that represent the greatest risk are given the highest priority for plugging and site restoration.Report an Orphaned Well »STRONGERThe Gas and Oil regulatory program participated in the State Review of Oil and Natural Gas Environmental Regulations (STRONGER).  STRONGER is a multi-stakeholder nonprofit organization comprised of equal representation from the oil and gas industry, state environmental regulatory agencies, and the environmental public advocacy community.  STRONGER's work focuses primarily on two areas: developingGuidelinesfor state oil and gas environmental regulatory programs, and conductingReviewsof volunteer state oil and gas environmental regulatory programs against the criteria of those Guidelines.  Virginia participated in an Initial Review in 2004 with a follow-up review in 2016.  The reviews concluded that the "programs are well managed, professional, and generally meet the STRONGER Guidelines."Share:Energize Your InboxSign up for email alerts to keep up with the progress we're making on energy, mining, mineral, and geological initiatives across the Commonwealth.Contact UsOffice:Gas and Oil3405 Mountain Empire Rd.Big Stone Gap, VA 24219Tel: (276) 415-9700MOREGrantsMethane Mitigation GrantMethane Mitigation InformationGas and Oil Program AwardsNomination Form2023 Award WinnersQuick LinksInspector Area MapUncashed Royalty Checkse-Forms CenterEscrow Estimator AppDisbursement UpdatesData Information SystemInteractive GIS MapResource MaterialsHydraulic FracturingOwnership RightsFOIAOil ProductionNatural Gas ProductionCareers
