They provide facility owners and the public with a discharge specific interpretation of the law and regulations. They provide a specific set of effluent limits, a monitoring schedule and a reporting schedule. Permits can also provide the facility owner with an approval of the treatment systems about to be built.The Bureau of Water operates several permit programs. The NPDES permit program, the state construction/operating permit program, agrichemical facility permit program in conjunction with the Illinois Department of Agriculture, and the Section 404 permits/Section 401 water quality certification program in conjunction with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.Do I Need a Water Pollution Control Permit?National Pollutant Discharge Elimination SystemThe National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) has its origin in the Federal Clean Water Act. The program requires permits for the discharge of treated municipal effluent, treated industrial effluent, coal and non-coal mining discharges, Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations (CAFO's), public water supply treatment plant discharges, pesticide discharges, and stormwater. The permits establish the conditions under which the discharge may occur and establish monitoring and reporting requirements. This federal program is delegated to the states, with Illinois receiving delegation on October 23, 1977.Statewide NPDES MapsNPDES Application FormsNPDES Rules and RegulationsStormwater Permitting PagePesticide Permitting PagePublic Water Supply General NPDES PermitDomestic Lagoon Wastewater Facilities General NPDES PermitCAFO NPDES PermitNon-coal Mine General NPDES PermitCompliance and Enforcement of NPDES PermitsHydrostatic Testing of Pipelines and Tanks General NPDES PermitWater Pollution Control - State Construction / Operating Permit ProgramThe state construction / operating permit program is based in the state Environmental Protection Act and the regulations developed by the Illinois Pollution Control Board.
