If so, you will need to file anAir Quality Modeling Submittal(AQ MM).Prior to filing their AQ MM, applicants should review theMassaschusetts Air Quality Modeling Guidanceto be sure they are familiar with current practices and procedures for estimating impacts from stationary sources of air pollution recommended by MassDEP (see Additional Resources below).  This guidance supplements the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA’s)Guideline on Air Quality Models in Appendix W to 40 CFR Part 51, which applicants should also review.Refined modeling is the method of modeling emission sources preferred by MassDEP.  Refined modeling is an analytical technique that allows for a detailed treatment of physical and chemical atmospheric processes. It requires the use of 5 years of hourly meteorological data.   A link to the latest available 5 years of pre-processed meteorological data in AERMOD-ready format is in Additional Resources below.Modeling guidance revised June 10, 2024Key ActionsFile an Air Quality Modeling SubmittalAdditional ResourcesOpen  file,Download Meteorological DataOpen PDF file, 1.19 MB,Massachusetts Air Quality Modeling Guidance (revised 6/10/24)(English, PDF 1.19 MB)Key OrganizationsAir Quality Modeling Questions?morelesscontact infoOnlineContact MassDEPglenn.pacheco@mass.govEnvironmental Justice Fact SheetIf you are applying for a Major or Non-Major Comprehensive Plan Approval (CPA), you will need to prepare and upload as an attachment a draft two- to four-page Fact Sheet providing details about your proposed project and neighboring communities.
