In the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is the permitting authority and NPDES permits are typically co-issued by EPA and the Department of Environmental Protection (MassDEP). NPDES permits regulate wastewater discharges by limiting the quantities of pollutants to be discharged and imposing monitoring requirements and other conditions. The limits and/or requirements in the permit ensure compliance with the Massachusetts Surface Water Quality Standards and Federal Regulations, all of which were written to protect public health and the aquatic environment.An individual permit is specifically tailored to the site-specific conditions of a single discharger. After receipt of a complete application, the permitting authority develops a permit for a particular facility based on the information contained in its application (e.g., type of activity, nature of discharge, receiving water quality). The permitting authority issues the permit to the facility for an effective period not to exceed five years.A general permit is not tailored to a specific facility but rather written to cover multiple dischargers with similar operations and types of discharges. Once issued, dischargers may request coverage, consistent with the permit eligibility and authorization provisions. Dischargers covered under general permits know their applicable requirements before obtaining coverage under that permit. In order to request coverage an applicant must submit a Notice of Intent (NOI) to EPA and may also, depending on circumstances described below, need to apply to MassDEP.What is the difference between major and minor facilities?The designation of major and minor facilities is determined by EPA. For POTWs, major facilities are generally those with a design flow of 1 MGD or greater, or have an industrial pretreatment program. Some smaller facilities may be designated as major for other reasons. For non-POTWs, major facilities are those that score 80 or more points on theEPA NPDES Permit Rating Sheet. Facilities that have questions about their major or minor status should contact EPA or MassDEP (see contact information).What is the difference between the WM05, WM06, WM07, and WM15 designations?For those applicants required to submit an individual permit application or general permit NOI to MassDEP, the MassDEP Transmittal Form must also be submitted. In Section A of the MassDEP Transmittal form, Permit Information, item 1 is Permit Code. The codes and associated fees are as follows (Note that payment does not apply if exempt):Application Fees:WM05, Major NPDES Surface Water Discharge Permits: $6,785WM06, Minor NPDES Surface Water Discharge Permits: $3,170WM07, Modification to NPDES Permit: $985WM15, NPDES General Permit (Not required for all applications): $500WM05 and WM06 facilities are also charged an annual compliance fee.
