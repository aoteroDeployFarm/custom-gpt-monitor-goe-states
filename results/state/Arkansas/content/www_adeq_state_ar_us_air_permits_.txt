Air PermitsThe Permits Branch issues new permits and permit modifications to existing facilities
					after reviewing and evaluating
					permit applications for administrative and technical completeness and ensuring that each application
					meets regulatory
					adequacy. The permit is written to meet state and federal regulations to include information on
					which pollutants
					are being released, how much may be released, and what kinds of steps the source's owner or operator
					is taking to
					reduce pollution. All permits will include a mechanism to demonstrate compliance with the permit
					conditions. There
					are two types of air permits: Minor Source and Major Source/Title V. To view a facility-specific air
					permit or permitting
					activity, please use the "Databases" link in the left menu of this web page. If you have questions
					about a specific
					facility or permit please contact us.General Air

												for Confidential InformationApplicants can submit confidential information. The presumption is that all
										material submitted to the Air Office is available
										for public review unless specific procedures are followed to claim
										confidentiality. Arkansas Code Annotated
										§ 8-4-308, APC&EC Rule 18, Chapter 14: Public Information and
										Confidentiality and APC&EC Rule
										19, Section 19.413 Confidentiality contain the requirements for confidential
										information. Applications and other
										material claiming confidentiality will be returned to the applicant unprocessed
										if these requirements are not
										met.APC&ECAir RegulationsRegulation

												Strategy – Revised April 2015A tool
												for evaluating hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) andnon-criteriapollutant emissionsThe DEQNon-Criteria
											Pollutant Strategyis a tool for the evaluation of hazardous air pollutant (HAP) and non-criteria
										pollutant emissions.
										It is important to note that the Strategy is not a regulation but rather a
										screening methodology used to determine if the emission of air contaminants from
										the facility may occur in quantities sufficient
										to constitute air pollution as defined by the Arkansas Air Pollution Control
										Code (DEQ Rule 18). In practice,
										the Strategy will begin a regulatory exercise to determine whether additional
										information concerning proposed
										non-criteria air emissions from a facility is necessary.Based on past experience, the Strategy has been revised to
										limit the scope of pollutants evaluated.The first two steps of the Strategy are known as the
										presumptively acceptable emission rate (PAER) and the presumptively
										acceptable impact level (PAIL). The initial screening of non-criteria emissions
										is performed by calculating
										the PAER for each pollutant. If the emissions fail to pass the PAER, then an
										emission model is developed using
										the newest version of the AERMOD air quality model approved by the US EPA. If
										this modeling indicates potential
										off-site impacts at levels greater than the PAIL for one or more non-criteria
										pollutants, then the facility
										may take any combination of the following measures:Use refined modeling to predict lower concentrationsRevise emission rate estimatesUse alternative risk assessments to develop site specific presumptively
											acceptable impact levelsPropose additional control of emissions of the contaminants of concernPropose alternative operating scenarios that result in lower modeled
											concentrationsInstall ambient air monitors at appropriate locationsAccept emission limitations in a permit that result in lower modeled
											concentrationsConsideration of (unfenced) property lines and areas where there will be no
											impact on human health can be considered.
											Generally, all facility property can be excluded from the model if there is
											no general access by the public.
											Other impacted areas, such as roads, rivers, and other uninhabited property,
											can be excluded on a case by
											case basis.The full text of the Strategy, including a more detailed
										description of the determination of PAER and PAIL, can
										be found by viewingNon-Criteria
											Strategy.Greenhouse
												Gases (GHGs) PermittingGHG
												permitting is required only for facilities also required to obtain a
												permit under the requirements of Rule
												19 Chapter 9 Prevention of Significant Deterioration.In accordance with the recent Supreme Court decision and EPA guidance, GHG
										permitting only applies to sources otherwise required
										to obtain a PSD permit. Arkansas regulations requiring a permit otherwise are
										stayed and not enforceable.Permit Fee FactorAs required by Arkansas Pollution Control and Ecology Commission Reg. 9.502(A), the permit fee factor used to calculate fees for air permits will be adjusted for inflation from $27.27/ton to $28.14/ton beginning October 1, 2023.Reg. 9.502(A) provides that the $/ton factor shall be increased annually by the percentage, if any, by which the federal Consumer Price Index exceeds that of the previous year (except under limited circumstances).SEEKE&E's new data management systemInformation PageSite Administrators for Air PermitsAir Permits ContactsAir PermitsThomas
