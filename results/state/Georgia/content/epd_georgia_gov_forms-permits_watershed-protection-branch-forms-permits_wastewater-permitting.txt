Wastewater PermittingThe Environmental Protection Division (EPD), Wastewater Regulatory Program has been delegated the authority by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to administer permits for the treatment and disposal of domestic and industrial wastewater under the Clean Water Act. A permit is required from EPD for any facility that intends to discharge, land apply, or inject wastewater or fluid within the State.EPD offers four types of permits based on themethod of disposalutilized by a facility as shown in the following table. More information on each type of permit, including types of dischargers, the application process, and permit requirements, can be found at the corresponding links.PermitsDescriptionNational Pollutant Discharge Elimination SystemPermitsAnyone that discharges or intends to discharge treated wastewater into a water(s) of the StateLand Application SystemPermitsAnyone who applies or intends to land apply treated wastewaterIndustrial PretreatmentPrograms and PermitsA POTW that accepts process wastewater or anyone that discharges process wastewater to a POTWUnderground Injection ControlPermitsAnyone who injects or intends to inject fluid into the subsurfaceBeyond simply the method of disposal,permit classificationsare further based on whether the source of the influent isdomestic or industrial, whether it is anindividual or a generalpermit, and finally as either amajor or minorfacility.Despite the varying classifications, however, all types of permits contain similarrequirementsfor the conditions of operation/treatment and reporting, as well as certain standard conditions.Permit ClassificationsSources of InfluentThe Wastewater Regulatory Program designates permitted facilities based on the type of influent that the facility treats: domestic (sanitary sewage) wastewater or industrial wastewater. While some facilities may treat both types of influent (such as a POTW with an approved Pretreatment Program), the classification is based on the majority percentage of the influent. Facilities within these categories include, but are not limited to, the following:Domestic Wastewater FacilitiesIndustrial Wastewater FacilitiesPublically Owned Treatment Works (POTW) - Such as Municipalities, Counties, or Other Public AuthoritiesAny private facility that generates a non-domestic process wastewaterPrivate and Institutional Development (PID) - Such as Real Estate Companies, Hotels, Churches, or Mobile Home ParksAny private facility that generates a non-domestic non-process wastewater, such as cooling waterIndividual PermitsIndividual permits may be issued for NPDES, LAS, Industrial Pretreatment, and UIC discharges and may be issued to public and private facilities. These permits provide site specific effluent limitations based on the individual processes of the facility, the specific receiving stream designated uses, any applicable State and Federal Regulations, water quality standards, or drinking water standards. Each facility is required to submit its own application package and will be issued an individual permit.Effluent limitations and other parameters included in an individual permit may vary based on whether a facility has been designated asmajor or minorbased on the following criteria:Domestic Wastewater FacilitiesIndustrial Wastewater FacilitiesMajor: Flow greater than or equal to 1.0 MGD or has a Pretreatment ProgramMinor: Flow less than 1.0 MGDMajor: Determined by EPA’sNPDES Permit Rating Work SheetIf you would like to receive an individual permit,individual permit applications & forms can be found here.General PermitsA selection of NPDES and LAS General Permits has been created to cover multiple facilities with similar operations.

These conditions are classified based on standards, permitting, and reporting.Each of the permit pages further defines these conditions; however, specific information onpermit conditions and reporting conditionsmay also be found at the corresponding link.ContactsWastewater Regulatory ProgramIndustrial Permitting UnitMunicipal Permitting UnitWatershed Data Management UnitKelli-Ann Schrage, Manager(470) 607-3078Kelli-Ann Schrage, Manager(470) 938-3351Benoit Causse, Manager(470) 938-3353Michele Brossett, Manager(470) 524-4699
