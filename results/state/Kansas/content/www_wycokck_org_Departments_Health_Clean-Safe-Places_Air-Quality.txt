Air Quality







Air Quality


Our Division of Air Quality is a local air quality program that works to provide a cleaner, healthier environment for the residents of Wyandotte County, KS. The division's goals are met by regularly inspecting facilities that are subject to permits and local, state, and federal air quality laws and monitoring ambient air quality at our local station.
Paid for in partnership with the Kansas Department of Health and Environment.


Monitoring and Air Quality Data

Environmental Scientists are responsible for operating an extensive ambient air quality monitoring network in Wyandotte County.Â 
This program monitors the ambient levels of pollutants such as ozone (O3), carbon monoxide (CO), sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and particulate matter (PM). It also operates a complex weather station. Federal health levels, or National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS), are set for each of the six major pollutants. This program monitors five of the six pollutants to ensure their levels do not increase above the NAAQS. This group coordinates closely with the Mid-America Regional Council and the other state and local agencies in the region to ensure that data is collected and reported.

Ozone
Ozone Season is March 1st - October 31st
Ground-level ozone occurs from the reaction of emissions from motor vehicles, lawn and garden equipment, power plants, and industry in the presence of heat and sunlight. Since heat and sunlight are most prevalent during the summer, ozone levels are typically highest from June to August.
High ozone levels harm young, old, and people with chronic lung disease. Ozone is not created solely by industry. Every day, things make more than 60% of ground-level ozone. Like what time of day you fill your car, driving habits, and when you mow your lawn all impact Kansas Cityâs air quality.
Visit ourÂ DAQ Public EducationÂ page to find more tips to reduce pollution.Â 



Permitting and Technical Services

The Permitting and Technical Services Program reviews and issues construction permits for new or modified sources of air pollution in Wyandotte County. This program also performs technical studies and evaluations, emission calculations, technology reviews, regulatory applicability determinations, etc.
Kansas Title V Operating Permit Program became effective in February of 1996.
Applications
VisitÂ kdhe.ks.govÂ for applications and other information. Please use the KDHE forms.Â 
KDHE Bureau of Air has developed an online application and reporting tool known as the Kansas Environmental Information Management System (KEIMS). Through this system you will be able to manage and submit permit applications and compliance reports. Please use the following link to set up a new account visitÂ Kansas Environmental Informational Management SystemÂ (Select âCreate an Accountâ and follow the steps). Once you have set up your account email KDHE.BOAKEIMS@ks.gov to associate your account with your facility. If you use SLEIS to submit an emission inventory your KEIMS account should be linked and may need to be activated. EmailÂ KDHE.BOAKEIMS@ks.govÂ for assistance.
Questions?
Please direct questions concerning calculating projected or potential emissions, applicability, or fees toÂ airquality@wycokck.orgÂ or callÂ (913) 573-6700.

















Public Education
The DAQâs Public Education and Outreach program aims to enhance our interaction with the community and industry to create awareness and generate interest in air quality, transform behaviors and habits and encourage voluntary air pollution-reducing actions.
















Open Burning
Get information about open burning and burn permits. "Open burning" is the burning of unwanted materials such as paper, trees, brush, leaves, grass, and other debris where smoke and other emissions are released directly into the air.
