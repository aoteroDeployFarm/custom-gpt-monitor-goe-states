Permits are required to build, erect, alter, replace, operate, use or maintain existing point sources of water pollution. The majority of our permits are for discharging treated wastewater from domestic and industrial facilities. We also issue permits for land application of wastes from domestic, industrial and agricultural facilities. Our permits usually specify requirements for regular wastewater sampling at the discharge points. In the case of land application, the permit specifies the methods by which wastes are handled and disposed. Permits also specify water quality standards for any discharges.Most wastewater permits are written to be site-specific, issued to that one location to reflect the unique nature of the wastewater or the receiving water. These permits are normally effective for five years. As a permit nears its expiration, it is redrafted, modified if needed and made available for public review and comment for 30 days on the department'sWater Public Noticeswebpage. After the public comment period ends, the department reviews the comments. The permit is then either issued with needed changes or modified and put on public notice again to resolve any concerns.Master general permits, as opposed to site-specific permits, are issued to multiple locations where activities are similar enough to be covered by a single set of requirements. For wastewater discharges, these permits are identified by the prefix MO-G in the permit number. The conditions in master general permits are also made available for public review and comment for 30 days before being issued to applicants. General permits for airports, limestone and rock quarries, lubricant manufacturing and petroleum storage greater than 50,000 gallons are required to be made available for public review and comment before issuance to a new facility. After finalization, a general permit cannot be modified. All facilities receiving a general permit must follow the conditions contained in that general permit until it expires or until the facility obtains a site-specific permit.Applications in ProcessInformation about permit applications in process is available in the departments'sMissouri Clean Water Information Systems (MoCWIS)application. The Applications in Process Searchprovides a list of water pollution permit applications received by the department. An application is considered ‘In Process’ from the date it is received until it is closed. An application is closed when the permit is issued, the application is denied or the application is withdrawn by the applicant.Applications in ProcessIn This Section:Water Public NoticesIssued Site-Specific Wastewater PermitsWastewater VariancesConstruction Permits and EngineeringNo-Discharge Wastewater TreatmentOn-site Septic Systems and SubdivisionsSanitary Sewer OverflowsUnderground Injection ControlWater-related Sites of InterestMaster General PermitsDischarge CategoryPermitEffective DateExpiration DateAdditional FilesDescriptionMO-G010000 Concentrated Animal Feeding Operation (CAFO)03/01/202302/29/2028Form F - Application for Construction Permit for Concentrated Animal Feeding Op…SIC #0211, 0212, 0213, 0214, 0241, 0251, 0252, 0253, 0254, 0259 or 0272Process wastes are collected and reused as fertilizer by spreading onto agricultural fields at agricultural rates.
