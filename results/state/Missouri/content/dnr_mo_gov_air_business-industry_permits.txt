The department issues a variety of air permits to businesses and individuals that have the potential to emit air pollution through industrial processes or open burning. Permits describe how a facility is required to meet state and federal air quality regulations to reduce air pollution and protect public health. The permit also documents all sources of air pollution at the facility, what pollutants will be released, how much is released and what steps the permittee is required to take to reduce pollution.**Important Update**The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency published a final rule reclassifying the Missouri portion of the St. Louis ozone nonattainment area from Moderate to Serious nonattainment for the 2015 ozone standard. On June 6, 2025, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit issued an order granting Missouri’s motion to stay the effectiveness of EPA’s final rule, which changed and added new permitting requirements. While the stay is in effect, the moderate nonattainment area permitting requirements will remain in place.
