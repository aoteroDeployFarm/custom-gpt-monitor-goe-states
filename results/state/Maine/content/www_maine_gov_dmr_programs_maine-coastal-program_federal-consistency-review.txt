The CZMA grants Maine and other coastal states that have an approved coastal management program the authority to review federal activities, federal license or permit activities, and federally funded activities to ensure that federal actions that may affect itscoastal areameet the "enforceable policies" of the State's coastal program. The process by which a state decides whether a federal action meets its enforceable policies is called federal consistency review.The Department of Marine Resources coordinates and provides a point of contact for federal consistency review in Maine. TheMaine Guide to Federal Consistency Review (pdf, 686 KB)lists the enforceable policies of Maine's Coastal Program and outlines the State's federal consistency review process. In Maine, standards and criteria of state environmental permitting and licensing laws and regulations serve as the enforceable policies of the Maine Coastal Program. Accordingly, the MaineDepartment of Environmental Protectionand other state agencies in Maine's networked coastal program review and make findings that serve as the basis for the state's consistency decision in much the same way that they evaluate license and permit applications under the state environmental laws and regulations.Rules issued by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Office of Ocean and Coastal Resource Management (OCRM) -15 CFR Part 930- govern the deadlines and other procedural aspects of the federal consistency review process.CZMA Consistency Submissions – E-mail Filing OnlyJune 16, 2023- Effective immediately, all CZMA consistency-related documents filed with or inquiries about federal consistency to the DMR/Coastal Program must be submitted by e-mail.
