NPDES WastewaterQuick LinksNPDES Permit ApplicationsNPDES Permitting ProcessOverviewAll wastewater discharges to surface waters in the State of North Carolina must receive a permit to control water pollution.  TheClean Water Act of 1972initiated strict control of wastewater discharges with the responsibility of enforcement given to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).  The EPA then created theNational Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES)to track and control point sources of pollution.  The primary method of control is by issuing permits to dischargers with limitations on wastewater flow and constituents.  The EPA delegated permitting authority to the State of North Carolina in 1975.The NPDES program at the Division of Water Resources is responsible for the issuance of wastewater discharge permits.  This process includes determining the quality and quantity of treated wastewater that the receiving stream can assimilate, incorporating input from stream modeling, collaborating with Regional Office staff, and evaluation of the discharger’s location.The NPDES program is managed by three units in the wastewater permitting branch:Industrial PermittingMunicipal PermittingCompliance and Expedited PermittingWhere appropriate, the NPDES program establishes limits for flow (quantity discharged), conventional pollutants (BOD, pH, TSS, fecal coliform, oil & grease, etc.), toxicants (metals, volatile organics, etc.), and non-conventional pollutants such as ammonia and nutrients.  Delegated states have the authority to establish state water quality standards which can be more stringent than federal standards established by EPA.For more information about the application process, links to our applications, and other types of forms, please visit theNPDES Permitting Process page.In addition to administering the NPDES program in North Carolina, there is also the responsibility of enforcement of the discharge limitations through our NPDES Compliance program. Please visit theNPDES Compliance webpagefor more information and to accessCompliance-related forms. Please note that the penalty for discharging without a permit is a fine of up to $25,000 per day.NPDES Permitting GuidanceGeneral Permitting GuidancePollutant-Specific Permitting GuidanceBasin-Specific Permitting GuidanceFacility Specific Permitting GuidanceNPDES Compliance GuidanceLinks to Related ProgramsTab/Accordion ItemsGeneral Permitting GuidanceEngineering Alternatives Analysis(Jan 2024)NC Model Mercury Minimization PlanReduction of Monitoring Frequencies for Exceptional PerformanceMixing ZonesSwamp WatersZero-Flow StreamsTrout Farm Permitting Policy for Lake SanteetlahPlanning For An Expansion: A Guidance Document for MunicipalitiesPollutant-Specific Permitting GuidanceToxicity TestingFecal ColiformTotal Residual ChlorineTotal Residual Chlorine Compliance LevelTotal MetalsNPDES Implementation of Instream Dissolved Metals Standards – Freshwater StandardsNPDES Implementation of Instream Dissolved Metals Standards – Saltwater StandardsBasin-Specific Permitting GuidanceGoose CreekNPDES Color Permitting Policy(South Fork Catawba River)Facility Specific Permitting GuidanceWater Treatment Plant (WTP) StrategyAssessment & Recommendations for WTP Permitting: Findings of the WTP WorkgroupBulk Oil TerminalsVehicle Pressure WashingNPDES Compliance GuidanceNPDES Compliance and Enforcement InformationSignificant Figures and Their Use on Discharge Monitoring Reports (DMRs)DMR CalculationsNPDES Reporting RequirementsWastewater Treatment Plant Annual Report GuidelinesSpecial Order by Consent (SOC) Guidance DocumentActive Special Order by Consent (SOC) listNPDES Standard ConditionsDissolved Metal to Total Metal Limit Calculators:Includes median HUC hardness values, user guide and calculators to assist permittees in understanding how the proposed Surface Water Standards (dissolved metals) impact permit limits.Links to Related ProgramsStormwater Permitting ProgramDEQ Customer Service CenterMunicipal Unit- Pretreatment: Sewer collection system permits and pretreatmentLand Application Unit: Non-discharge permits such as wastewater disposal systems consisting of surface irrigation, high-rate irrigation, recycling, or reuse.Additional Important Links***NPDES Compliance and Enforcement Memo for Counties Affected by Tropical Storm Helene"  (Dec 12, 2024)NPDES ApplicationsNPDES Current Active and Expired Individual Permits ListNPDES Standard ConditionsNCG530000 Frequently Asked Questions about Trout Farms General Permit(2021)Managing Emerging Compounds in Watere-DMR:EPA’s Electronic Reporting Rule and how it may affect permit holders.Precision in Discharge Monitoring Reports:Summarizes common conventions (and exceptions) for significant figures and rounding and describes their proper use in completing DMRsNPDES Staff ContactsSubscribe to DWR's Public Notice Listserv by filling out the form below:Full Name:Email:Daily digest summary formatundefinedOn This Page Jump LinksOff
