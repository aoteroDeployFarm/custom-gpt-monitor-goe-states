These tiers include:An integrated and dedicated Shale-Gas Monitoring TeamRelated forest resource monitoring and on-the-ground management activitiesResearch and external partner collaboration. These tiers form the foundation for DCNR's shale-gas monitoring effortAn essential function of the Shale-Gas Monitoring Program is to regularly compile and analyze its data and findings.This first report is also an opportunity to communicate basic information about the bureau’s monitoring program and its plans for future monitoring efforts.Gas Policy and GuidelinesThe DCNR Bureau of Forestry’s mission statement clearly identifies the environmentally sound utilization of mineral resources, which includes oil and gas, as a key component of state forest management.Oil and gas management decisions must be based on the mission, and work toward ensuring the long-term health, viability, and productivity of the Commonwealth's forests and conserve native wild plants.Additional ResourcesDCNR Guidelines for Administering Oil And Gas Activity on State Forest Lands (PDF)DCNR Draft Oil and Gas Lease for State Forest Lands (PDF)Shale Gas MonitoringNatural Gas Advisory Committee
