The permit number identifies the permit type.Construction permit numbers start with two digits to indicate the year the permit application is received by the DNR. These numbers are followed by three letters that indicate the construction permit type. The last three numbers are assigned sequentially by the DNR beginning with “-001” at the start of each calendar year. Example: ## –ABC-###. If there is an “-R” with a number after the last three digits, that means the permit is a revision of a construction permit.The table below provides examples of the numbering scheme for different construction permit types:Example Construction Permit NumberPermit Type24-MIN-001Minor construction permit issued under ch.
