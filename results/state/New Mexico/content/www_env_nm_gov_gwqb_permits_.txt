The Permitting Program of the Ground Water Quality Bureau consists of the Agriculture Compliance Section, Mining Environmental Compliance Section, and Pollution Prevention Section. Together, these sections issue groundwater discharge permits pursuant to 20.6.2 NMAC (The New Mexico Ground and Surface Water Protection Regulations), 20.6.6 NMAC (Supplemental Permitting Requirements for Dairy Facilities), and 20.6.7 NMAC (Supplemental Permitting Requirements for Copper Mining Faculties) to ensure that industry, wastewater facilities and other activities that discharge water to the environment do not result in groundwater contamination. Permits must be renewed every 5 years.
Public notices of permit applications and draft permits are available on the NMED Public Notices page.
Types of facilities that NMED issues permits for include:  

domestic wastewater facilities;
large capacity (greater than 5,000 gallons per day) septic tank leachfield systems;
