NPDESPermitsWastewater, construction, stormwater, and pretreatment are managed through the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit program, authorized bySection 402 of the federal Clean Water Act. DEQ has authority from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to issue     NPDES permits, which control the discharge of treated wastewater into streams, rivers, and other waterways. You may need an NPDES permit if your facility pretreats or discharges wastewater, is a construction site, or is required to manage stormwater runoff.The Water Office prepares two types of permits within the discharge permit program: individual
				and general. Anindividual permitis prepared for a specific facility with unique 
				permit limits and conditions. DEQ has developed general permits for certain kinds of facilities 
				with similar operations and types of discharge. Coverage under the general permits is less complicated 
				and requires less paperwork than the individual permits while still protecting the environment. This 
				agency organizes its general NPDES permits asstormwaterandnon-stormwater.Discharge permit applications are divided by business sector or type of discharge and whether 
				they are general or individual permits.NPDES Permits Quick Links:Draft Water Permits at Public NoticeWater Permits Applications, Forms, Instructions, and DocumentsNotifications of Notice of Intent:MS4 Permit NOI SubmittalsGeneral Permit NOI SubmittalsPermit Description, Instruction and Applications:Individual NPDES PermitsGeneral Stormwater PermitsGeneral Non-Stormwater PermitsPretreatment ProgramPretreatment Facility Data and City Contacts:Pretreatment Regulated Industries/Facilities DataPretreatment: City ContactsNon-Pretreatment: City ContactsNPDES Permit ContactsIndividual NPDES501-682-5876General Stormwater501-682-5876General NPDES501-682-5876Pretreatment501-682-5876Questions or Comments?
