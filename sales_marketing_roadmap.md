## ✅ Phase 1: Finalize the GPT Build (In Progress)

You're already well into this phase:

* ✅ GPT name, description, and instructions (`gpt_instructions.md`)
* ✅ OpenAPI connected to `/api/check`, `/api/tags`, etc.
* ✅ File structure, tagging, hash mapping, change tracking — all solid
* 🔄 Currently polishing UX and tagging logic

Let’s wrap this fully first — maybe one final test pass.

## 📦 Phase 2: SOP Toolkit for Teams

This is where your **video + slide deck + README-level documentation** comes in.

Here’s what we can prep:

### 🎞️ **1. Demo Video Script**

Goal: A short (2–5 minute) narrated walkthrough for devs, PMs, or sales.

Includes:

* What is the Regulatory Monitor GPT?
* What problems does it solve?
* How to use it (prompt examples, filtering)
* How it connects to the live API
* How the backend scraper works (optional: high-level explanation)
* Where the exports live
* Where to find recent updates or changes

💡 We can write the script first, then record it using Loom or OBS.

### 📊 **2. Slide Deck: SOP for Sales + Dev Teams**

Suggested slides:

1. **Overview**: What is Regulatory Monitor GPT?
2. **Personas**: Who uses this? (compliance, energy execs, PMs)
3. **Key Features**: API scraping, tag filtering, update detection
4. **How It Works**: System architecture diagram
5. **Using the GPT**: Screenshots + prompt examples
6. **Back End Structure**: Where scrapers live, export formats
7. **Maintenance**: How to update URLs, tags, or triggers
8. **Deployment**: API host + Custom GPT action linkage
9. **Troubleshooting**: Common issues & fixes
10. **Next Steps**: Ideas for alerts, frontend, Slack integration

---

### 📘 **3. SOP Markdown Documentation**

Can be committed to the repo and shared internally:

* `SOP.md` for devs
* `TRAINING.md` for sales team

We can version these with timestamps, and link them in the repo’s README or even in the GPT instructions (`Ask me for a walkthrough of how the system works — or say 'show me the SOP'`).
