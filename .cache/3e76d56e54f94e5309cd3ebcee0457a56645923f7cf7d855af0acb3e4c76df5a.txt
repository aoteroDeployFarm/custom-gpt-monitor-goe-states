It is valid for up to five years, but can remain in force even after it expires so long as the facility has submitted a complete and timely application for renewal, and MassDEP has not yet issued a determination.Key OrganizationsMassDEP Regional Contacts for Air Permits & Approvalsmorelesscontact infoOnlineMassDEP Regional OfficesFind Your RegionCentral Region Permit Chief: Tom Hannahthomas.hannah@mass.govNortheast Region Permit Chief: Ed Braczykedward.braczyk@mass.govSoutheast Region Permit Chief: Mark Poudriermark.poudrier@mass.govWestern Region Permit Chief: Marc Simpsonmarc.simpson@mass.govMassachusetts Operating Permit FacilitiesAbout 125 facilities across Massachusetts are subject to federal Title V Operating Permit requirements.
