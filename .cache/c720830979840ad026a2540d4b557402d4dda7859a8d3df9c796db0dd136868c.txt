Federal Consistency
Coastal states have a special responsibility to protect America's  ecologically and economically significant coastal and marine resources.  Consequently, coastal states have authority over a broad range of activities  that could affect these coastal zone resources. New Jersey's coastal zone  extends to the limit of its territorial waters, three nautical miles (3.5  statute miles) to sea from its shoreline. While many coastal activities are  under direct control of the state, actions by federal agencies or actions in  federal waters beyond a state's territorial waters, may adversely affect a  state's coastal or marine resources or uses. Federal consistency serves as an  important tool that provides states the ability to protect their coastal and  marine resources and uses by ensuring that federal actions are consistent with  the states' coastal policies.
 Federal actions subject to federal consistency review fall into  three categories. These are: Federal Agency Activities, which are direct  actions of federal agencies, Federal Licenses, Permits, and Other Regulatory  Approvals, which are permits or licenses granted by federal agencies to a  public or private entity, and Federal Financial Assistance to State and Local  Governments, which is federal funding granted by federal agencies to State or  local governments. Federal consistency addresses federal actions that occur  within a state's coastal zone, as well as inland of a state's coastal zone, in  the coastal zone of another state, or in federal waters (beyond the limit of  the state's territorial waters, as described above).
						      In the United States, coastal areas are managed through the  Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972 (CZMA). This law authorizes individual  states to develop plans that incorporate the strategies and policies they will  employ to manage development and use of coastal land and water areas. Each plan  must be approved by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).  One of the components of an approved plan is enforceable policies, that is,  state policies that are legally binding and by which a state exerts control  over coastal uses and resources. In New Jersey, the enforceable policies are  contained in the Coastal Zone Management rules, N.J.A.C. 7:7, the Freshwater  Wetlands Protection Act Rules, (N.J.A.C. 7:7A), Stormwater Management rules,  (N.J.A.C. 7:8), New Jersey Pollutant Discharge Elimination Systems rules,  (N.J.A.C. 7:14A, Subchapters 1, 2, 5, 6, 11, 12, 13, 15, 16, 18, 19, 20, 21, 24  and 25), and the Hackensack Meadowlands District Zoning Regulations (N.J.A.C.  19:4 portions of Subchapters 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8 and 9 as noted below). Three  major state laws are implemented through the Coastal Zone Management rules: the  Waterfront Development Law, N.J.S.A. 12:5-3, the Wetlands Act of 1970, N.J.A.C.  13:9A, and the Coastal Area Facility Review Act (CAFRA), N.J.S.A. 13:19. The  Hackensack Meadowlands Reclamation and Development Act, N.J.S.A. 13:17,  Freshwater Wetlands Protection Act, N.J.S.A. 13:9B and the Law concerning the  transportation of dredged materials containing polychlorinated biphenyls  (PCBs), N.J.S.A. 13:19-33, the NJMC Master Plan, the November 5, 2005  Memorandum of Agreement between the NJDEP and New Jersey Meadowlands  Commission, and the Department’s “Technical Manual for Evaluating Wildlife  Impacts of Wind Turbines Requiring Coastal Permits” are additional enforceable  policies. Please see the enforceable policies web page (www.nj.gov/dep/cmp/czm_enforcepolicies.html) for  additional information and links to the enforceable policies.  Most federal consistency determinations are  made by the Division of Land Use  Regulation, with the Office of Dredging and  Sediment Technology conducting reviews for dredging and port activities.
Consultation, coordination, and cooperation between applicants,  state agencies, and federal agencies are critical to the success of the New  Jersey Coastal Management Program’s Federal Consistency Program.  To facilitate this collaborative effort and ensure  the federal consistency review process occurs in a timely manner, all federal  consistency determinations, certifications, and negative determinations shall  be submitted to:

Colleen Keller, Assistant  Director
 NJDEP, Office of Policy and Coastal Management
  501 East State Street, Trenton, NJ 08625-0420
Mail Code 501-02A
Phone: (609) 633-2289| Fax: (609) 633-3656

  The  New Jersey Coastal Management Program encourages electronic submission of  consistency determinations, consistency certifications, and negative  determinations.  Please send electronic submissions along with a completed Federal Consistency Request Form to  LURFederalConsistency@dep.nj.gov. 
Questions regarding  New Jersey’s federal consistency process should be directed to Colleen Keller  at DEP LURFederalConsistency@dep.nj.gov   or by telephone at (609)984-0058.
  NOAA encourages coastal states to list federal actions that are  subject to federal consistency review. The purpose of this listing is to  improve coordination between federal and state agencies by describing the state  process for federal consistency review, as well as the types of activities that  the state intends to review.  The New  Jersey Coastal Management Program has prepared a Federal consistency guidance  document that describes federal consistency, the categories of Federal actions  and associated review procedures. Below are links to New Jersey’s federal  consistency listings and guidance document.
