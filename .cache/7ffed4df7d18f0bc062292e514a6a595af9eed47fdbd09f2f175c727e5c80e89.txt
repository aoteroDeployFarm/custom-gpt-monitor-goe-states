The Bureau of Air Quality (BAQ) issues permits limiting the amount of regulated air contaminants emitted at a facility. The BAQ issues construction permit, operating permits, general permits, and registration permits.Construction PermitA construction permit is an air permit required for any person who plans to construct, alter, or add to a source of air pollution, including the installation of any air pollution control device. The construction permit must be issued before any construction-related activities occur at the site. The construction permit allows for installation, modification, and start of operation of equipment.Operating PermitOnce construction has been completed, a facility must request an operating permit to operate. The operating permit contains all of the specific record keeping and reporting requirements, emissions limitations and compliance status, and conditions necessary as mandated in state and federal air pollution control regulations.General and Registration PermitsGeneral and Registration permits are issued to sources that have similar operations.ExemptionsThere are several kinds of construction permit exemptions available, source-specific exemptions and emission-level exemptions.Downloads & LinksAir Permitting ContactsForms and ApplicationsTagsBureau of Air QualityEnvironment
