A person wishing to engage in the business of servicing septic systems must obtain a permit from the department.StormwaterThe department regulates pollution from stormwater runoff from large municipalities and urbanized areas, industrial facilities, and most construction projects. Stormwater permits provide a level of treatment through planning and management that minimizes pollution in runoff from urban areas, construction sites, and industrial facilities.Temporary DischargesThe department authorizes the discharge of relatively uncontaminated water from temporary dewatering activities such as the hydrostatic testing of pipes, tanks or similar vessels; disinfection of potable water lines; construction dewatering; and the treatment of gasoline or diesel-contaminated groundwater.ContactsEmail List (click to expand) then click "Program" to sortFilterLast NameFirst NameE-Mail AddressProgramPhoneAhlstedtCarterahlstedtcarter@nd.govWQ Ground Water Monitoring701-328-9172AndersonCarlcjanders@nd.govWQ Ground Water Monitoring701-328-5213AndersonEriceric.anderson@nd.govWQ Watershed Management701-328-6092BeckerSarahsebecker@nd.govWQ Spill Investigation701-328-9151BehmNicolenicbehm@nd.govWater Quality Division701-328-7969BrazilEmilyebrazil@nd.govWQ Watershed Management701-328-5296DelzerAlexisadelzer@nd.govWQ NDPDES Permitting701-328-5282DettlingKyleekdettling@nd.govWQ NDPDES Permitting701-328-5187DunbarMeganmsdunbar@nd.govWQ NDPDES Permitting701-328-1427EspeBradybespe@nd.govWQ NDPDES Permitting701-328-5228GilleyCameroncgilley@nd.govWQ NDPDES Permitting701-328-5210GrossJoejlgross@nd.govWQ Watershed Management701-328-5292GrossmanDallasdgrossma@nd.govWQ NDPDES Permitting701-328-5242HansonLawrencelawrence.hanson@nd.govWQ NDPDES Permitting701-328-5291HaroldsonMartymharolds@nd.govWQ NDPDES Permitting701-328-5234HiteNicolenhite@nd.govWQ Spill Investigation701-328-1676HouleBrianbHoule@nd.govWQ Watershed Management701-328-5193KaiserDondkaiser@nd.govWQ Spill Investigation701-328-5151KruskeMontanamkruske@nd.govWQ NDPDES Permitting701-328-5172LibunaoTatetlibunao@nd.govWQ Special Projects701-328-9182McCauleyJennaJenna.McCauley@nd.govWQ Watershed ManagementMillerMeridithmeridith.miller@nd.govWQ Watershed Management701-328-5166NovakEmileeejnovak@nd.govWQ Watershed Management701-328-5240SchickMcKenziemschick@nd.govWQ Watershed Management701-328-5288SchiwalAlyssaaschiwal@nd.govWQ Ground Water Monitoring701-328-5159SchuettPatrickpschuett@nd.govWater Quality Division701-328-5235StockdillScottsjstockdill@nd.govWQ Spill Investigation701-328-5241StrommenRachelrstrommen@nd.govWQ NDPDES Permitting701-328-5244SuessBillbsuess@nd.govWQ Spill Investigation701-328-5216SuggsShannonssuggs@nd.govWQ Ground Water Monitoring701-328-6409VanDykeChayccvandyke@nd.govWQ Watershed ManagementWaldron FeldSarahsfeld@nd.govWQ NDPDES Permitting701-328-5237WalleryPaigepWallery@nd.govWQ Spill Investigation701-328-5243WertJoshuajewert@nd.govWQ Watershed Management701-328-5014WestercampBenjaminbwestercamp@nd.govWQ NDPDES Permitting701-328-6032WoutatTannertwoutat@nd.govWQ Ground Water Monitoring701-328-5233
