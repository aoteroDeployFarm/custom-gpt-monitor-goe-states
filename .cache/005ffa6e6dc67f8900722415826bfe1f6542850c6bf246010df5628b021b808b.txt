The Electronic Permitting (ePermitting) system was developed to help the regulated community apply for and receive Missouri State Operating General Permits. Currently, ePermitting can be used to apply for and receive a newLand Disturbance Stormwater General Operating Permit (MO-RA00000). In the future, ePermitting may be expanded to include other general permits; some construction permits (sewer extensions); operating permit renewals, modification and terminations; and permits-by-rule.Note:General operating permits for land disturbance activities cannot be modified after issuance. When using ePermitting, it is the responsibility of the user to ensure all data is complete and accurate. If errors are found after the permit is paid for and issued, the facility may have to obtain a new permit and pay another fee. Please contact the ePermitting Helpdesk with any questions.How to Access ePermittingThe ePermitting system is accessed through the department'sMissouri Gateway for Environmental Management (MoGEM)online portal system. You must have a MoGEM account in order to access ePermitting.
