The permit also ensures that facilities make adequate provisions to control their emissions.Depending on the size of the facility and the amount of emissions produced, stationary sources can be either major or minor sources. These permits may include limits on both construction and operation activities. A person must apply for the permit before starting construction or operation of any emitting equipment.The new source review program requires that industrial sources install good pollution control technology when they construct or significantly modify their facilities.Permitting ContactsNAMETITLE/AREAEMAILPHONESantosh MathewPermitting ManagerMathew@ClarkCountyNV.gov702-455-1685Michael RaelPermitting Supervisor – Major SourcesRael@ClarkCountyNV.gov702-455-2966Stephen DeyoPermitting Supervisor – Minor SourcesDeyo@ClarkCountyNV.gov702-455-1675Stylerightsection, no-button
