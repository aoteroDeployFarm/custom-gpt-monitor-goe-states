It promotes coordination between state and federal policies, programs, and agencies.The review process relies on and seeks to improve existing state programs. Federal regulations (15 CFR 930) establish the basic policies and procedures for coastal states, federal agencies, and other affected parties pertaining to the federal consistency review process.If you are involved in a federal action that may be subject to federal consistency review, please see the relevant federal consistency section of theprogram documentand theSpecific State Coastal Policies. The program document describes the federally-approved Wisconsin Coastal Management Program​​​​​.​For more general information on federal consistency, please see the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s website,Applying Federal Consistency​.Questions?
