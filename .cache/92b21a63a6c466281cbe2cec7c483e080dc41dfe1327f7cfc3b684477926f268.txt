April 8, 2021 Re-Public Notice
On April 8, 2021, the Department of Health Clean Water Branch (CWB) published in the Hawaii Tribune-Herald its tentative recommendation to renew a Water Pollution Control Permit for the Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT) International Observatory, National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) Permit No. HI S000431.
The previously public-noticed documents were worded in a way that may imply that the Director of Health has made certain determinations with respect to the permit application and were, therefore, rescinded. The current public notice will incorporate all previously submitted public comments (May 23, 2019, public notice and June 25, 2019 public hearing) into this new public comment record. The CWB is extending the public comment period an additional 30-days, which is now scheduled to end June 7, 2021.
Written comments can be emailed to [email protected] or mailed to our office at 2827 Waimano Home Road, #225, Pearl City, Hawaii 96782. All mailed comments must be post marked no later than June 7, 2021. The new permit recommendation and fact sheet can be viewed below.
