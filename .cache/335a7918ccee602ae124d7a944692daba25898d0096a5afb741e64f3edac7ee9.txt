The authority includes a review process that coastal states with federally approved coastal programs undertake, every time a federal activity is proposed in that state'sCoastal Zone. The review process is usually triggered under three circumstances; when thefederal activity is proposed by a federal agency, when afederal permit is needed for a proposed project, or when a project receives federal assistance (e.g. funding). The process assists early coordination between the state and a federal agency planning an activity that may affect coastal resources and uses.Learn more about the federal consistency review process.Where Does Federal Consistency Apply?Federal consistency applies to any project that affects a coastal use or resource, whether inside or outside of the coastal zone boundary. However, there are specific rules that apply to areas outside of the coastal zone boundary. Areas outside of the coastal zone must be within a designated geographic location description (GLD).Learn moreabout where the federal consistency review process applies and Oregon's only designated GLD regarding marine renewable energy.Enforceable Policies of the ProgramThe Oregon Coastal Management Program (Program) is made up of42 partners at the county and city leveland11 state agencypartners. Each local entity has documents governing how they operate and guiding how they administer land use in their community. Each state agency has chapters of statutes guiding operations and helping them administer state law. These documents include comprehensive plans and land use regulations, state statutes, and statewide planning goals. DLCD incorporates the documents in their entirety into the Program.Within the various statutes, goals, plans, and ordinances only certain elements meet the criteria to be used for federal consistency review. These special policies are called enforceable policies. Alegal definition of enforceable policiesis available in the federal regulations.See a list of the Program's enforceable policies.Learn how to identify enforceable policies using thisNOAA training module.Oregon Coastal Management Program ChangesAs statutes, rules, and local plans and ordinances change over time, it is the responsibility of the Oregon Coastal Management Program to keep its federally approved enforceable policies up to date through the NOAA Program Change process. This process may also be used to add or remove enforceable policies from the federally approved coastal program.DLCD posts public notices for all proposed program changes on ourPublic Notice and Comment page.
