Regulations adopted by the Forsyth County Commissioners help protect the quality
            of our air. These include local, state and federal air quality requirements limiting
            or controlling emissions from stationary sources of air pollution. While all must
            comply with Air Quality Regulations, certain facilities and businesses must also
            apply for Permits to Construct and Operate Air Pollution sources. Other facilities
            and businesses must register their air pollution source or submit notifications.

                    may need an Air Quality Permit. Permits set forth specific compliance obligations
                    and meet federal and state requirements. Air quality permits ensure that permittees
                    know what their air quality obligations are and how to comply with those obligations.Forms and InformationFormFile TypePermit Application Formsicon iconPermit Application InstructionsiconD3-3 Formsicon icon iconDispersion Modeling ProtocoliconDisperson Modeling GuidelinesiconToxics Modeling WorksheeticonStack Test Protocol Formicon iconCounty Services
