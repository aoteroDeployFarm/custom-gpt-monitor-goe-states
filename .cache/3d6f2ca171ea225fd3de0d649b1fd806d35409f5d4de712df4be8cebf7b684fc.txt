Construction permits, also called New Source Review permits, are required for constructing a new air pollution source, or modifying an existing source. Construction and modifications refer to activities that will increase air emissions, including changes in operation, adding equipment, changes in fuel or raw materials and relocating previously permitted sources. Certain activities have been determined by the state to be an insignificant source of emissions and are exempt from permitting requirements, according to10 CSR 10-6.061. For information about operating installations, please visitAir Operating Permits.**Important Update**The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency published a final rule reclassifying the Missouri portion of the St. Louis ozone nonattainment area from Moderate to Serious nonattainment for the 2015 ozone standard. On June 6, 2025, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit issued an order granting Missouri’s motion to stay the effectiveness of EPA’s final rule, which changed and added new permitting requirements. While the stay is in effect, the moderate nonattainment area permitting requirements will remain in place. For more information, please review the document below.Air Permitting Impacts of the St. Louis Ozone Reclassification to Serious NonattainmentNote: The following information is not meant to be a tool to determine applicable federal and state regulations for a specific situation. The method of choice should always be a thorough review of the state and federal rules and regulations.In This Section:Pending Air PermitsIssued Air PermitsOverviewConstruction permits allow an installation to construct and operate an air emission source. Construction permits are required prior to commencing construction of an emission source. Construction may not begin until a construction permit has been issued. Therefore, it is recommended the applicant allow ample time for review and issuance of the permit in the planning stages of a project. In certain cases, an applicant may apply for a pre-construction prohibition waiver to begin construction prior to receipt of the approved permit.A construction permit does not expire, although construction must begin, upon receipt of the construction permit, within 18 months for a major project and within two years for a minor project. Since construction permits have time requirements, a facility may need to obtain several construction permits if the sources of air emissions are installed at different times.For information about a construction permit, contact department staff atAirPermitApplications@dnr.mo.gov. Stakeholders also may use this email address to submit permit applications and amendments. Applications for permits and amendments require a filing fee. For information on how to pay the fee, contact the accounting section of the department's air program atDNR.APCPCreditCards@dnr.mo.gov.  Payment and hard copy construction applications may be submitted by mail to the Missouri Department of Natural Resources, Air Pollution Control Program, PO Box 176, Jefferson City, MO 65102-0176 or electronically atAirPermitApplications@dnr.mo.gov.Introduction to Air Construction PermitsDiscussion of Potential to Emit- Potential emissions are different from actual emissions.List of Regulated PollutantsOverview of the Permit Review ProcessThe existing potential emissions of the installation and the potential emissions of the project determine the type of permit required for the construction activity.The Permitting Process- This document gives general information on how to determine what type of permit is needed.Permit Applicability Determination Flow Chart for Criteria Air PollutantsPermit Applicability Determination Flow Chart for Hazardous Air PollutantsProjects Exempt from Construction PermittingPermit TypesSummary of Permit TypesThe department's Air Pollution Control Program issues several types of construction permits: Major, Minor and De Minimis permits, portable relocation permits, temporary permits, and permits-by-rule.
