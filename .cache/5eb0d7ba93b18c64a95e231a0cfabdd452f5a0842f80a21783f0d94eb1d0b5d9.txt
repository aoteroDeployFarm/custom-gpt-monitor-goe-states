IDL also issues and administers oil and gas leases for mineral estates held by other state agencies, including Fish and Game, Parks and Recreation, and Transportation.Revenue generated from leasing oil and gas resources on endowment land provides vital funding to the endowment beneficiaries, including Idaho’s public schools.Idaho’s constitution requires IDL to maximize the revenue generated from these lands for the beneficiaries.Any individual, company or governmental agency that desires to extract oil and gas associated with state-owned mineral estates must first obtain an oil and gas lease from IDL.Program ContactProgram ManagerBoise Staff OfficeMike Murphymmurphy@idl.idaho.gov(208) 334-0290Upcoming Oil and Gas Lease AuctionsIf you wish to receive anemail alertregarding newly posted oil and gas lease auctions for IDL, please click on the email link below and request to have your email address added to the oil & gas auction alert list:email link:oilandgasleasing@idl.idaho.govThe list below includes parcels already nominated and scheduled for public auction.“No data”will show below if no auctions are currently scheduled, please check back again later.Quarterly dates for potential future oil & gas lease auctions are listed further down this webpage.Tentative Dates for Oil and Gas Lease AuctionsNew nominations for oil and gas leases are subject to the following tentative quarterly auction dates.“Click” on the dates below for additional information.July 2025Nomination Closing:April 17, 2025Tentative Registration Deadline:July 17, 2025Tentative Auction Date:July 24, 2025October 2025Nomination Closing:July 17, 2025Tentative Registration Deadline:October 16, 2025Tentative Auction Date:October 23, 2025January 2026Nomination Closing:October 16, 2025Tentative Registration Deadline:January 15, 2026Tentative Auction Date:January 22, 2026April 2026Nomination Closing:January 15, 2026Tentative Registration Deadline:April 16, 2026Tentative Auction Date:April 23, 2026July 2026Nomination Closing:April 16, 2026Tentative Registration Deadline:July 16, 2026Tentative Auction Date:July 23, 2026October 2026Nomination Closing:July 16, 2026Tentative Registration Deadline:October 15, 2026Tentative Auction Date:October 22, 2026Oil and Gas Expiring LeasesOil and Gas Lease Royalty AuditLands and minerals owned by the state are leased to make money for endowment land beneficiaries.
