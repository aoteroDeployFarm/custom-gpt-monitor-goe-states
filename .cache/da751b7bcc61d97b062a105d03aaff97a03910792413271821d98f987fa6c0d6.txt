This is accomplished through a myriad of activities that primarily include operator and excavator education, natural gas infrastructure and operator inspection, statute development and enforcement, and investigation of incidents and accidents within the state of Wisconsin. These activities all ultimately converge towards the Wisconsin Pipeline Safety Program’s fundamental responsibility of protecting the public and the environment from the hazards intrinsic to the transportation of natural gas.The program inspects approximately:23 gas operators, including 11 utilities5 liquefied natural gas (LNG) facilities80,000 miles of gas pipelines2 million customers servedBackgroundThe Wisconsin Pipeline Safety Program is a federal program under the direct responsibility of theU.S. Department of Transportation. TheNatural Gas Pipeline Safety Act​gave jurisdiction over all gas pipeline safety in the U.S. to the Secretary of Transportation. However, it also provides that any state with a law comparable to the Pipeline Safety Act in scope and intent could enter into an agreement with the Secretary of Transportation to carry out safety enforcement in that state. The Wisconsin legislature passed theWis. Sta​t. § 196.745and gave the PSC jurisdiction over all intrastate gas pipeline safety in Wisconsin except propane distribution systems.TheWisconsin Administrative Code for the PSCestablishes pipeline safety standards in the state at least as stringent as theFederal Regulations.Interstate pipelines are regulated by the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHM​SA​​).InspectionsThe Wisconsin Pipeline Safety Program evaluates all natural gas pipeline system operators under Wisconsin jurisdiction to verify compliance with the requirements of the Wisconsin Administrative Code Chapters PSC133,134, and135and the Federal Minimum Safety Standards under 49 CFR Parts191,192,193, and19​​9,as applicable.​The types of inspections and investigations include:Operation and Maintenance PlanRecords InspectionPublic Awareness PlanAnti-Drug and Alcohol PlanEmergency PlanOperator Qualification PlanDistribution Integrity Management Program PlanIntegrity Management Program PlanControl Room Management Plan​Damage Prevention PlanLNG InspectionConstruction InspectionRegulator Station InspectionField InspectionExcavation Damage ComplaintsThe results of these investigations are viewable on thePipeline Safety Docket Search​ page.​​​SitingInterstate pipelines proposals are reviewed by theFederal Energy Regulatory Commission(FERC).Intrastate natural gas pipelines and facilities construction, installation, or use  may require authorization or notification of the PSC if the project meets the criteria inWis.
