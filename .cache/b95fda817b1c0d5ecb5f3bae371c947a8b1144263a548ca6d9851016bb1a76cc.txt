Energy Facilities Siting Board(EFSB)+Table of ContentsContact usWho we serveI want to…EventsThe Energy Facilities Siting Board (EFSB) is an independent state board that reviews proposed large energy facilities including power plants, electric transmission lines, intra-state natural gas pipelines, and natural gas storage tanks.  To obtain EFSB approval, a proposed facility must demonstrate that it would provide a reliable energy supply, with a minimum impact on the environment, at the lowest possible cost.  The Department of Public Utilities (DPU) administratively supports the work of the EFSB and its staff, but the nine-member EFSB makes its decisions independently.  EFSB staff also conducts DPU siting-related cases that do not fall within the EFSB’s jurisdiction.EFSB Distribution Lists(NEW) Sign up to receive notificationsPlease use the form below to sign up to receive notifications from the EFSB regarding upcoming proceedings and regulations.Sign up formContact UsOnlineEmailsitingboard.filing@mass.govPhoneEFSB/DPU Siting Division(617) 305-3525DPU Main(617) 305-3500AddressDepartment of Public Utilities1 South Station3rd floorBoston, MA 02110DirectionsWho we serveThe EFSB serves:Energy consumersby ensuring a reliable supply of energy at the lowest possible cost.Communities and residentsby ensuring that approved facilities have minimized environmental impacts such as: air emissions, noise, traffic, waste, electric and magnetic fields, wetlands and water quality degradation, visual intrusions, and risks to public health and safety.Energy facility developerswho must obtain EFSB approval to construct proposed facilities.Federal, state, and local agenciesthat are also involved in the review and permitting of proposed energy facilities.Where would you like to go?Energy Facilities Siting BoardDPU Siting Division(NEW) Siting and Permitting Reform UpdatesUpcoming EventsAug25Evidentiary Hearing #3: Everett Battery ProjectMonday, August 25, 202510 a.m. - 4 p.m.Aug27Evidentiary Hearing #4: Everett Battery ProjectWednesday, August 27, 202510 a.m. - 4 p.m.See all eventsfor the Energy Facilities Siting BoardRelated organizationsDepartment of Public UtilitiesImage credits:George HeadleyHelp Us Improve Mass.govwith your feedbackDid you find what you were looking for on this webpage?YesNoIf you have any suggestions for the website, please let us know.How can we improve the page?*Please do not include personal or contact information.You will not get a responseThe feedback will only be used for improving the website.Please remove any contact information or personal data from your feedback.You will NOT get a response.Use the information on this page to contact the Energy Facilities Siting Board.Please let us know how we can improve this page.Please remove any contact information or personal data from your feedback.You will NOT get a response.Use the information on this page to contact the Energy Facilities Siting Board.Thank you for your website feedback!
