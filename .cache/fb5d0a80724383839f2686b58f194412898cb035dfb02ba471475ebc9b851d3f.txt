Once a permit to construct is issued, the facility may be built and once it is completed the Permit to Operate program ensures that the facility stays in compliance with air rules.Air Permitting Program ProcessConstruction PermittingA facility must first submit an application for a construction permit (PTC) for any source required underNDAC 33.1-15-14. When the permit application is received by the department it will be reviewed for completeness. Once a completed application is received, staff review the equipment and operation processes to verify that the facility will be constructed per applicable State and Federal regulations. If it is expected that the facility will adhere to all applicable rules then a Permit to Construct (PTC) is issued.Operating PermitsOnce a facility has been constructed, the Department will inspect it to verify that the facility was constructed per the issued PTC. If the facility is in compliance with the PTC an operating permit (PTO) may be issued to the permittee. The PTO states reporting, testing, and record-keeping requirements that apply to the facility to assist the facility in operating in compliance and help identify any non-compliance issues.Help with the Permitting ProcessClean Air Act Rules and Regulations are numerous and often complex.  If your company does not have in-house Clean Air Act expertise, we suggest you consider obtaining the services of an environmental consultant before starting the permitting process. A list of consultants who have asked to be listed with us is located below. The Department makes no recommendation on any individual or firm. The list is provided for informational purposes only. Consultants interested in being placed on the list should contact the North Dakota Department of Environmental Quality at 701-328-5188 or email Air Quality (AirQuality@nd.gov).List of ConsultantsPermitting TopicsAir Toxics (HAPs)Construction Permitting (PTC)ModelingOperating Permits (PTO)Aerial SprayingOpen BurningView Issued Permits(PTCs & PTOs)View Construction Permits Under ReviewPermit LimitsWhat type of permit a facility falls under is determined in part by the facility's potential to emit for the seven criteria pollutants and amount of hazardous air pollutant (HAPs). Permits fall into two groups: Permit to Construct (PTC) and Permit to Operate (PTO). Under a Permit to Construct there are two types of facilities with regards to the PSD program: minor sources and major sources (PSD). Under a Permit to Operate there are two types of facilities: minor source and major source (Title V). Within minor sources are true minor sources with no federally enforceable limits and synthetic minor sources where a source accepts a federally enforceable operating limit to stay under major source limits.It should be noted that although PTCs and PTOs have very similar permit conditions and both programs use the terms Minor and Major, that they are two different programs with different requirements.Permit TypeCriteria AirPollutantLimit1CombinedHazardousAir Pollutant(HAP) Limit2SingleHAP LimitFederallyEnforceableLimits (Y/N)Minor Source [PTC & PTO]<100 tons/yr< 25 tons/yr< 10 tons/yrNoSynthetic Minor Source3[PTC & PTO]<100 tons/yr< 25 tons/yr< 10 tons/yrYesTitle V4Source [PTO]≥100 tons/yr≥ 25 tons/yr≥ 10 tons/yrYesPSD Source [PTC]≥100 or 250 tons/yr5≥ N/A tons/yr6≥ N/A tons/yr6Yes1Criteria PollutantCriteria Air Pollutant limit applies to each individual pollutant and is not a combined total amount.2List of Hazardous Air Pollutants3Sources that have the potential to emit 100 ton/yr or greater of a criteria pollutant, 10 ton/yr or greater of any hazardous air pollutant, or 25 ton/yr or greater of any combination of hazardous air pollutants, and the permittee accepts a federally enforceable limit in the Permit to Operate that limits the potential to emit to the same criteria specified for a minor source.4In addition, some sources will require a Title V permit because of applicability under the Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) program; PSD levels apply to construction permits not to operating permits. Sources (electric generating units) that require a Title IV Acid Rain Permit as part of their Title V Permit to Operate.5The PSD program has listed 28 source catigories where the threshold is at 100 tons per year inlcuding fugitives, all other sources are 250 tons pre year of criteria pollutants without fugitive emissions—for this list see40 CFR 52.21(b).6Note: PSD only applies to criteria pollutants.Public Comment, EPA Review, & Affected State RequirementsPermits to Construct and Permits to Operate may require public comment periods, EPA review, and/or affected state review prior to issuance.  These requirements depend on the type of permit to be issued. For any permit that requires publication in a newspaper, the newspaper refers to the newspaper of record of the county in which the facility is located. All permits subject to public comment period will be posted on the North Dakota Department of Environmental Quality website underPublic Comments & Notices.Note that on November 17, 2106 EPA removed the public notice through newspaper posting if notice and documents were posted as an e-notice see81 FR 71613.Public Comment for Permits to ConstructPermit Type30-Day Public Comment RequiredMajor Source (PSD)Initial IssueYes  (newspaper & website)Major Source (Title V)Initial IssueYes (website)Synthetic MinorInitial IssueYes (website)True Minor or Minor by Rule1Initial IssueNoModification of Issued PTC1SeeNDAC 33.1-15-14-02.6for public comment modification rules.1A public comment period may be required if there is a significant level of public interest or if a public comment period has been requested by the permittee or the public.A 30-day public comment period is required for PTCs which are:Affected facilities underChapter 33.1-15-13— Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants.New sources that will be required to obtain a Permit to Operate under theTitle V Permit Program.Modifications to an existing facility that will increase the potential to emit from the facility by the following amounts:One hundred tons [90.72 metric tons] per year or more of particulate matter (PM, PM10PM2.5), sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), hydrogen sulfide (H2S), carbon monoxide (CO) or volatile organic compounds (VOCs); orTen tons [9.07 metric tons] per year or more of any contaminant listed undersection 112(b)of the Federal Clean Air Act; orTwenty-five tons [22.68 metric tons] per year or more of any combination of contaminants listed undersection 112(b)of the Federal Clean Air Act; orSources that the Department has determined to have a major impact on air quality, sources that have received a request for a public comment period from the public, a source with a significant degree of public interest, or those sources that request a federally enforceable permit which limits their potential to emit (i.e. synthetic minor permits).Permit to Operate— Title V and Title IV (Acid Rain)Permit Type30-Day Public Comment Required45-Day EPA Review1(Subsequent to Public Comment)30-Day EPA Review1(Concurrent with Public Comment)30-Day Affected State Review(if ≤ 50 miles)Initial IssueYes (newspaper & website)YesNoYesRenewalYes (newspaper & website)YesNoYesAdministrative AmendmentNoNoNoNoMinor Modification3No2YesNoNoSignificant ModificationYes (newspaper & website)YesNoYes1The Department shall send a copy of the permit application with the draft permit for all EPA reviews, with the exception of Title V renewals, where the permittee is responsible for submitting a copy of the application to the EPA.2A public comment period may be required if there is a significant level of public interest or if a public comment period has been requested by the permittee or the public.3Within five working days of receipt of a complete minor permit modification application, the Department shall notify the EPA and affected states of the requested permit modification perNDAC 33.1-15-14-0.6e(1)(c).Permit to Operate—Synthetic MinorPermit Type30-Day Public Comment Required45-Day EPA Review1(Subsequent to Public Comment)30-Day EPA Review1(Concurrent with Public Comment)30-Day Affected State Review(if ≤ 50 miles)Initial IssueNo2NoNo2NoRenewalNo2NoNo2NoRevisionNo2NoNo2No1The Department shall send a copy of the permit application with the draft permit for all EPA reviews, with the exception of Title V renewals, where the permittee is responsible for submitting a copy of the application to the EPA.2Public comment and EPA review will be required for any synthetic minor source that was not issued a permit to construct (PTC) which underwent public participation for the synthetic minor limit(s).  Examples of such facilities would be asphalt plants, which are issued a PTO without a PTC.
