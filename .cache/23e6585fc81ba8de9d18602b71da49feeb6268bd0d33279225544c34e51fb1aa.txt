Facilities meeting state and federal requirements are issued construction permits which also include operating requirements to assure continued compliance.More detailed analyses are required for large and complex projects. Under the federal Clean Air Act, this includes those that involve Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD), Major Source Non-Attainment Area permitting, and State Implementation Plan (SIP) maintenance areas. Other sources would include facilities requesting limits to avoid regulations under these programs and brand new (Greenfield) facilities, etc. A more detailed analysis is required because of the impact large emission sources can have on a region.The Iowa DNR strongly encourages pre-application meetings in order to facilitate review and permitting of these large and complex projects. When both parties have clear expectations, the permitting process tends to be smoother. The DNR cannot assure how quickly that projects submitted without this prior coordination can be reviewed or permitted. Please review the guidance materials below for the type of project your facility will be proposing.

CHP is a method for a facility to generate power (electricity) and useful heat (steam) from one unit rather than using separate units. This reduces capital investment and increases overall efficiency. Facilities that have excess electrical or steam generating capacity may find CHP an economical option. If you are considering a CHP project, most likely you will need to apply for an air quality construction permit before you begin. Allow at least 65 days for construction permit application processing. There are several things to consider.Iowa’s Air Quality and Permission to ConstructTheAmbient Air Monitoringconducted across the state shows that air quality is good in most areas of the state. Construction permits help ensure new facilities are designed and built in such a way that air quality remains high, despite adding a new source of air pollutant emissions. Some common questions about permitting CHP facilities are answered in the following document:Combined Heat and Power Permitting FAQWhere to LocateThe location within a community chosen for a facility is important. The DNR has compiled theCleaner Air, Better Communities guideto assist in this key decision.Ambient Air AnalysisIn order to ensure that the Iowa’s air quality is maintained, an ambient air analysis may be required for projects that are projected to emit a larger quantity of emissions, or for projects locating in areas with existing emissions of air pollutants. Theconstruction permitting Form MDcan be used to determine if an analysis will be needed for a particular project.When an ambient air analysis is necessary, using dispersion modeling helps design the proposed facility so that it will comply with the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). The following information can be used to assist in this effort:Modeling guidelinesDispersion modeling data and additional guidanceDepending on the pollutants that will be emitted by the project, there are certain areas of the state that may require special consideration. This includes one area in Iowa currently designated as non-attainment: approximately one third of Muscatine County for the 1-hour sulfur dioxide (SO2) NAAQS.There are several other areas of the state that are classified as maintenance areas. These areas include Buffalo for particulate matter (PM10), Cedar Rapids (SO2), Clinton (SO2), Mason City (PM10), Muscatine (PM2.5), and Council Bluffs (lead). Locating in any of these areas will require special considerations to ensure that the proposed project will not cause or contribute to an exceedance of the national standards.Additional InformationThe Iowa Economic Development Authority has complied information to assist in the development of CHP projects in Iowa.Iowa Economic Development Authority CHP InformationBack to topConstruction Permitting ExemptionsList items for Construction Permitting ExemptionsSmall Unit ExemptionsAir Construction Permitting Exemption for Small UnitsSmall Unit Exemption (SUE) Eligibility for Equipment Subject to a NESHAPA facility owner or operator is not eligible to use the small unit exemption (SUE) (567 IAC subrule 22.1(2)”w”) if an emission unit emits a hazardous air pollutants and is “required to be reviewed for compliance” with a National Emission Standard for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP). This DNR guidance document helps explain this requirement, and includes several examples of equipment that can still use the SUE, and some equipment that may no longer qualify for the SUE because of NESHAP requirements.Small Unit Exemption - Cumulative Notice Threshold Summary FormExemption Justification Document TemplateManual Non-production ToolsManually Operated, Non-Production and Equipment Vented IndoorsOther ExemptionsExemptions are listed in the DNR's administrative rules; they are found in subrule 22.1(2) of 567 IAC.The administrative rules can be easily accessed on the Internet athttps://www.legis.iowa.gov/by following the following steps:Under Popular Publications, click on "Iowa Administrative Code"The agency is "Natural Resources Department [561]" - "Environmental Protection Commission [567]"Click on "Chapters"Chapter 22 (Controlling Pollution), Click on "pdf" or "rules"Exemptions are listed at the beginning of the chapter under 22.1(2)A hard copy of the administrative rules may also be obtained at the DNR records center.

This summary is designed to assist applicants as they prepare to submit an application. The information includes the number of projects or applications that the section is currently reviewing, and the average lead times for application review.Other metrics can be found on theEnvironmental Services Dashboard.Projects In-HouseThis graph provides an overview of all current in-house applications (or projects), and the applications that are received and issued each month. All applications are included in this tracking regardless of the type of review required. Projects are considered in-house from the date DNR receives them until the date the project is completed or issued.Standard ProjectsMost projects the Construction Permit Section reviews are standard projects. These application reviews do not trigger the more complex review needed due to specific air quality regulations or nearby existing air quality concerns.This graph has two lines. The first line represents each month’s average lead time. The other represents the past 52-week average lead time for completing projects in this category.The section’s goal is to issue all standard projects within 30 days of receiving the application.PSD/NA NSR Complex ProjectsComplex projects are projects that trigger review under the Major Source New Source Review (NSR) provisions of the air quality rules. This includes both the Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) and Non-Attainment New Source Review (NA NSR) programs.The line on this graph represents the past 52-week average lead time needed to complete projects in this category.Complex projects require more time to review. These projects are complex because they trigger specific federal air quality rules, or they are proposed in areas where there are already concerns about air quality. The section’s goal is to issue all PSD/NA NSR Complex projects within 180 days of receiving the application.Back to topSecondary Navigation MenuAir Quality(parent section)Air Pollutants(parent section)Fine ParticlesAir Quality & Farm OperationsAir Quality BureauLocal Air Quality ProgramsAir Quality Fees & ScheduleAir Toxics & National Emission StandardsAsbestos, Training Fires & Controlled BurnsAvailability of Air ResourcesComplianceAir Quality Construction PermitsCurrent ConditionseAir ServicesEmissions Inventory(parent section)Emission Tools & CalculatorsMinor Source Emissions InventoryGreenhouse GasesImplementation PlansModeling(parent section)Background DataElevation DataMeteorological DataMonitoring Ambient Air(parent section)Archived ReportsIn Your Neighborhood(parent section)Firework DisplaysHealth Effects of Air QualityOzone ReductionResidential Wood BurningVehicle ExhaustOpen BurningOperating Permits(parent section)Compliance & CertificationDraft & Final PermitsSmall SourcesTechnical GuidanceTitle V Forms & InstructionsPublic ParticipationPublic RecordsRules & PlanningSmall Business Assistance Program
