EPA adopted regulations (Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 1, Part 70) which required states and local permitting authorities to develop and submit a federally enforceable operating permit program for EPA approval.The State of Delaware developed Section 1130 of the state Clean Air Act regulations (7 DE Admin. Code 1130) which outlines Delaware’s Title V Permit procedures and requirements.What’s CoveredTitle V only applies to “major sources.” The EPA defines a major source as a facility that emits, or has the potential to emit (PTE) any criteria pollutant or hazardous air pollutant (HAP) at levels equal to or greater than the Major Source Thresholds (MST) set in the Clean Air Act. The Major Source Threshold for criteria pollutants may vary depending on the attainment status (e.g. severe, serious, extreme) of the geographic area and the Criteria Pollutant or HAP in which the facility is located.Major Source Thresholds for Delaware CountiesVolatile Organic CompoundsNitrogen OxideCarbon MonoxideSulfurParticulatesHazardous Air PollutantsOtherNew Castle252510010010010100Kent252510010010010100Sussex5010010010010010100Measured in tons per year. The threshold of 10 tons/year for HAPs is for a single HAP. The annual total threshold for all HAPs in 25 tons/year.Title V also requires that facilities subject to the program pay an annual fee sufficient to cover all reasonable direct and indirect costs associated with administering the Title V permit program. The fees are reviewed on a regular basis by theTitle V Operating Permit Program Advisory Committee, generally known as the Title V Fee Committee.Title V Forms and ApplicationsBasic Application FormsCompliance Certification ReportingRight-click and download documents as needed.
