About the Oil Conservation Division (OCD)
The Oil Conservation Division regulates oil and gas activity in New Mexico. The Division gathers well production data, permits new wells, enforces the division’s rules and the state’s oil and gas statutes, makes certain abandoned wells are properly plugged, and ensures the land is responsibly restored. Our website has been designed to provide you with information about doing business with the Oil Conservation Division of New Mexico, as well as to provide access to forms, services, and data provided by the division. Santa Fe office hours are from 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. Monday through Friday.
