Article 17 authorized creation of the State Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (SPDES) program to maintain New York's waters with reasonable standards of purity.The SPDES program is designed to eliminate the pollution of New York waters and to maintain the highest quality of water possible, consistent with:Public health.Public enjoyment of the resource.Protection and propagation of fish and wildlife.Industrial development in the state.New York's SPDES program has been approved by the United States Environmental Protection Agency for the control of surface wastewater and stormwater discharges in accordance with the Clean Water Act; however, the SPDES program is broader in scope than that required by the Clean Water Act as it controls point source discharges to groundwaters as well as surface waters.Conditions applicable to all SPDES permitsStormwater informationDetermine if you need a permitRegulated ActivitiesNew York State law requires a permit for:Constructing or using an outlet or discharge pipe (referred to as a "point source") that discharges wastewater into the surface waters or ground waters of the state.Constructing or operating a disposal system such as a sewage treatment plant.Permits are also required for modifying, transferring, and renewing your permit. See details below.Do Not Start a Project Before Obtaining a PermitYou must obtain all necessary permits before commencing work on a project that requires any DEC permit. Persons commencing work on such a project before obtaining the required permits, and any contractors engaged in such work, are subject to enforcement action by the DEC. Such action may include:Civil or criminal court action, or both;fines; oran order to remove structures or materials or perform other remedial action, or both a fine and an order.Exempt ActivitiesNo SPDES permit is required for a facility whose treatment system has a design flow of total discharges to ground water of less than 1,000 gallons per day of sewage-wastewater containing no industrial or other non-sewage wastes; however, these discharges may require approval from the appropriate city health department, county health department, or district office of the New York State Department of Health before a system (cesspool, septic system, etc.) can be built. They may also require other DEC permits or approvals from other agencies.Is this project Major or Minor?Minor SPDES projects:discharges of less than 10,000 gallons per day of sewage effluent, without the admixture of industrial wastes or other wastes, to ground water. Such projects may qualify for theP/C/I SPDES General Permit GP-0-15-001.All Other SPDES Projects are Major.Application of Standards, Limitations, and Other RequirementsSPDES permits must meet all applicable water quality standards and effluent limitations. DEC regulations,6 NYCRR Section 750-1.11(a),provide a list of standards, limitations, and other requirements.Modifying Your PermitRequests for permit modifications must be submitted by the permittee for facility modifications or expansions, process modifications, or production modifications. Typical modifications are:Any increase in the volume of the wastewater.Any change in the limitations on the contaminants in the wastewater effluent.Any change in the location of the discharge point.Any change from a discharge underground to a surface discharge, or from a surface discharge to an underground discharge.Any change in the type of treatment of the wastewater.A request for any of these modifications must include the appropriateapplication form, supporting documents, and anEnvironmental Assessment Form(EAF). The requested modifications must not be undertaken prior to receiving DEC's authorization.Be sure to include your previous DEC permit number and your SPDES number (e.g., NY-0100001) in your correspondence.Submit your modification request as early as possible. In most cases, modification requests submitted within 6 months (180 days) of an existing permit's expiration date will be combined with your renewal application for processing. Renewal applications are due 6 months before permit expiration.Contact theregional permit administratorif you have questions concerning your particular modification.Transferring Your PermitA change in facility ownership or a change in permittee name are types of permit modifications. These require anApplication for Permit Transfer (PDF).The Application for Permit Transfer requires certifications by both the proposed new owner/operator and the present permittee, and it should be submitted 30 days prior to transfer.Be sure to include your previous DEC permit number and your SPDES number (e.g., NY-0100001) in your correspondence.Contact theregional permit administratorif you have questions concerning a permit transfer.Renewing Your PermitSPDES permits for discharges to surface waters are typically issued for up to five years; and permits for discharges to ground waters are typically issued for up to ten years.A complete renewal application must be submittedat least 180 days prior to the permit's expiration date. DEC will attempt to mail a renewal application form to the permittee of record several months in advance of the expiration date of the permit so it can be submitted in time.The permittee is responsible for submitting a timely renewal application regardless of whether DEC sent you a renewal application.

The lists are based on a ranking system that prioritizes individual permits for full technical review and, when necessary, modification. Scoring data for each individual permit in the EBPS lists is available in theEBPS scoring details (PDF)document.For additional information on EBPS, please refer to TOGS 1.2.2 or this briefEBPS Overview (PDF).Design Standards and Engineering ReportsEngineering Report Outline and Engineering FormsThisEngineering Report Outline (PDF)describes the requirements for SPDES engineering report submittals that should be followed by all types of discharges and must be followed when a facility receives funding through the Environmental Facilities Corporation.Engineering reports shall be prepared, stamped, and dated by a New York State-registered Professional Engineer and developed in accordance with the latest editions of the following standards whenever practicable and as appropriate:Recommended Standards for Wastewater Facilities- Policies for the Design, Review, and Approval of Plans and Specifications for Wastewater Collection and Treatment Facilities (commonly known as the Ten States Standards).TR-16 Guides for the Design of Wastewater Treatment Works- New England Interstate Water Pollution Control Commission.New York State Stormwater Management Design Manual.New York State Design Standards for Intermediate Sized Wastewater Treatment Systems StatewideandLake George Design Standards.6 NYCRR Part 750-2.10.Intermediate Design Standards (2014)The 2014 New York State Department of Environmental ConservationDesign Standards for Intermediate-sized Wastewater Treatment Systems (PDF)(Intermediate Design Standards) provide wastewater treatment system design professionals, owners and operators, and regulators guidance on design, operation, and maintenance of intermediate-sized wastewater treatment facilities. This manual is a reference for both the Private/Commercial/Institutional SPDES General Permit, as well as individual permits for sanitary waste. These systems serve:Medium sized facilities discharging to surface and ground waters;Cluster housing and other multi-home developments; andPublicly Owned Treatment Works (POTWs) that discharge to groundwater.Excluded are residential systems (individual home septic systems), large POTWs, and industrial facilities.The Intermediate Design Standards provide design criteria for building wastewater treatment systems that protect the water quality of groundwater and surface water, aid designers in the preparation of complete project submissions (map, plan, and report), and improve the efficiency of project review by regulatory agencies. It is intended to incorporate newer technology for the onsite or near-site treatment of wastewater, as well as provide more design and installation guidance for wastewater treatment facilities. These developments have arisen from special needs, including the replacement of failing systems on limited-sized sites, lighter-weight construction materials, lower-cost sewage collection and treatment for remote or isolated locations, and special considerations for environmentally sensitive areas.Lake George Design Standards for Wastewater Treatment Systems (2015)The2015 Design Standards for Wastewater Treatment Systems in the Lake George Basin (PDF)are only applicable in the Lake George Basin for treated sanitary sewage discharging to groundwater without admixture of industrial wastes.Wastewater Treatment Upgrades, Expansions, and PlanningPlanning to upgrade, expand, or build a new wastewater treatment plant in New York State? Below are a few questions to consider before submitting aSPDES application. These guiding points will help to navigate potential changes in an individual SPDES permit and can aid in the decision making and design planning process.Ensure theregional permit administratorhas been contacted about the project. Additional permits may be needed and may impact project timeline.Identify the facility's receiving water and any present impairments orTotal Maximum Daily Loads (TMDLs). Theclassificationof the receiving water impacts the applicable water quality standards. TMDLs and impairments are incorporated into permit limitations.Facilities that discharge nearenvironmentally sensitive areassuch as bathing beaches, drinking water intakes, and areas with sensitive species may have limitations.Determine if the planned upgrades or expansion of the facility will impact the facility's influent waste stream's characteristics. If new waste streams are anticipated, these parameters will need to be evaluated. Expanded flows may reduce available dilution.Ensure the present or future treatment technology can adequately treat for pollutants present in the discharge. This can be helpful in developing the Schedule of Compliance to meet new limitations.Given the facility's outfall and receiving waters, identify the available dilution. Dilution impacts the assimilative capacity and ultimately, the water-quality based effluent limits.Near-by POTWsmay have capacity to accept the waste stream, eliminating the need for a direct discharge.Domestic wastewater contains nutrients. Ponded waterbodies are more susceptible to phosphorus and nitrogen impacts. Consider the receiving waters' assimilative capacity for these nutrients.A POTW will need to revise theSewer Use Lawif a pretreatment program is required.Below are resources that may help during design consideration.Resources for Publicly Owned Treatment WorksTechnology Based Effluent Limitations for POTWs:TOGS 1.3.3(PDF)New Discharges to POTWs:TOGS 1.3.8(PDF)New Discharge Request:2025 Form(PDF)Resources for IndustriesTechnology Based Effluent Limitations for industrial facilities:TOGS 1.2.1Effluent limitation guidelines and standards for industrial facilities:40 CFR Chapter I Subchapter NResources for All DischargersTo learn more about the environment in your area such asreceiving water classification, waterbody impairments, and endangered speciesvisit:DECinfo LocatorClassifications and Standards of Quality and Purity:6 NYCRR X AEndangered and Threatened Species:DEC Environmental Resource MapperTo learn about applicableWater Quality Standards:Surface Water and Groundwater Quality Standards and Groundwater Effluent Limitations:6 NYCRR 703.2, 703.3, 703.4, 703.5, 703.6Ambient Water Quality Standards and Guidance Values and Groundwater Effluent Limitations:TOGS 1.1.1To learn aboutWater Quality Based Effluent Limits:Total Maximum Daily Loads & Water Quality Based Effluent Limits:TOGS 1.3.1USGS StreamStats:StreamStats ApplicationUSGS SWToolbox:USGS SWToolbox Software,InstructionsUSGS Low-Flow Frequency Analysis of Streams in New York:Bulletin 74To learn aboutwaterbody impairments andTotal Maximum Daily Loads:NYS Section 303(d) List of Impaired/TMDL Waters:303(d) ListClean Water Plans:Clean Water Plans and Total Maximum Daily Load PlansTo learn aboutWhole Effluent Toxicity Testing and Water Treatment Chemicals:Acute and Chronic Toxicity Testing in the SPDES Permit Program:TOGS 1.3.2Water Treatment Chemical Notification Forms:Water Treatment ChemicalsTo learn aboutpollutant-specific limitations:Phosphorus Removal Requirements to Wastewater Discharges to Lakes & Lake Watersheds:TOGS 1.3.6Mercury Guidance:TOGS 1.3.10Below are helpful presentations on individual SPDES permit development.SPDES Permit Limitation Creation & Discharge Monitoring Rationale in NYS (PDF)State Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (SPDES) Permit Renewals, Reviews, and Municipal Application Updates (PDF)NPDES e-Reporting Rule- Information on the NPDES Electronic Reporting Rule and its requirementsVessel Incidental Discharge Act VIDA- The EPA issued the Vessel General Permit (VGP) effective December 19, 2008.Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations- Information about permits for Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations (CAFO).Contact for this PageDivision of Environmental Permits625 BroadwayAlbany,NY12233Phone:518-402-9167[email protected]This Page CoversNew York StateIcon
