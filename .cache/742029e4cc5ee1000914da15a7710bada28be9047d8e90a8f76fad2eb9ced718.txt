If you witness or are involved in a pipeline emergency or you smell gas, move to a safe location and call 911.Pipeline Safety DivisionOperatorsMUSTreport pipeline incidents to the Commission's Pipeline Safety Division within one hour of confirmed discovery.317-232-2707National Response CenterOperatorsMUSTreport pipeline incidents to the National Response Center at the earliest possible opportunity.800-424-8802What to do if you smell gas?If you smell gas:Ifindoors,leave your home/building immediately!DoNOTturn on or off lightsDoNOTmake calls from your cell phone or landline while at home.DoNOTcause a spark.Leave windows and doors open while exiting to allow gas to vent outside.Ifoutdoors, move away from the area and follow these steps.Call 9-1-1 and your natural gas utility (if you know the number) from a safe distance, away from the odor. Gas Company service personnel will be dispatched immediately.Wait for the Gas Company service personnel or emergency services personnel to tell you it's safe to return to your home/building.How to Recognize Where a Pipeline is LocatedMany buried pipelines used in the transportation of petroleum products and natural gas are identified by above ground pipeline markers. Pipeline makers help to identify the approximate location of the pipeline and provide critical information to the general public and emergency responders such as the company that operates the pipeline, product transported, and a phone number that should be called in the event of an emergency.At the link below, you can find additional information from PHMSA about how to recognize pipeline markers and what to do in the event a suspected leak is detected.Identify Pipeline MarkersIncident Response & Agency CoordinationAfter an incident occurs, local emergency departments and first responders will take the lead with support from gas operators to assess the situation. Once the incident site is considered safe, the Commission’s Pipeline Safety Division may be responsible for investigating the failure and could be on-site after an emergency for that reason. Depending on the situation, other state and federal agencies may also get involved such as theEnvironmental Protection Agencyto help with remediation or possibly theNational Transportation Safety Boardfor certain large-scale incidents.Regulation of Gas OperatorsLearn moreDamage to Underground FacilitiesLearn moreIndiana 811 Law TrainingLearn moreUnderground Plant Protection AccountLearn moreAbout the Pipeline Safety DivisionIn 1968, Congress passed the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act, which was the first federal statute regulating pipeline safety in the nation. The legislation also established the Office of Pipeline Safety, now under the U.S. Department of Transportation’s Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA), to oversee and implement the various regulations.Due to the vast number pipelines across the U.S., with some crossing state boundaries (interstate) and others running within (intrastate), the law included aframeworkthat allows for states to assume regulatory authority over intrastate gas pipelines, hazardous liquid pipelines, and underground natural gas storage, under a certification agreement with PHMSA. This was designed to ensure the uniform implementation of the pipeline safety program nationwide. To participate in the program, states must adopt the minimum federal safety standards; however, they can always pass more stringent state regulations.Federal JurisdictionPHMSA has jurisdiction over allinterstatepipeline operators. Interstate pipelines are those that transport gas or liquids thatcrossstate boundaries.State JurisdictionThe Commission has authority overintrastatepipeline operators only. Intrastate pipelines are those that transport gas or liquidswithinstate boundaries.In 1971, the Indiana General Assembly created the Commission’s Pipeline Safety Division to serve as the state’s pipeline safety authority. In partnership with PHMSA, the Division is responsible for enforcing state and federal regulations to ensure the safe and reliable operation of Indiana’s intrastate natural gas and hazardous liquid pipeline transportation system. This is accomplished largely through inspections, training, education and outreach, investigation of incidents, enforcement of compliance requirements, and monetary sanctions.The Division is also responsible for investigating alleged violations of Indiana's 811 law (Indiana Code chapter 8-1-26) and reporting its findings to the Underground Plant Protection Advisory Committee. To learn more about this process, visit ourDamage to Underground Facilitiespage.As aPHMSA certified state program, the Division receives most of its funding (up to 80% of program costs) through federal grants, which can be used to reimburse for personnel, equipment, and activity costs. Grant amounts are primarily determined through annual evaluations of the state’s program, alignment with federal rules and regulations, its annual reporting, and the availability of federal grant dollars.During any given year, the Division conducts around 900-1,000 inspections days of approximately 80+ jurisdictional natural gas pipeline operators. This includes distribution, gathering lines, hazardous liquid, liquified natural gas (LNG), master meter, and transmission operators.
