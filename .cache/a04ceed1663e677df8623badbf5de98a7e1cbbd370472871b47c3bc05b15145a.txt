HomePipeline SafetyAct 127 (Pipeline Act)Act 127 (Pipeline Act)The Gas and Hazardous Liquids Pipelines Act (also known as “the Pipeline Act” or Act 127 of 2011) was signed by Governor Corbett on Dec. 22, 2011 and went into effect on Feb. 20, 2012. This law expands the Commission’s authority to enforce federal pipeline safety laws as they relate to gas and hazardous liquids pipeline equipment and facilities within the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. The Pipeline Act requires the Commission to develop and maintain a registry of pipeline operators within Pennsylvania. The Commission recovers the costs of this program by assessments on pipeline operators based on the total intrastate regulated transmission, regulated distribution and regulated onshore gathering pipeline miles in operation for the transportation of gas and hazardous liquids in Pennsylvania during the prior calendar year.For questions about the PUC’s implementation efforts or to be placed on a distribution list regarding these efforts, please send an email tora-Act127@pa.gov.Final Order– On June 7, 2012, the Commission adopted the Final Order that clarifies that transmission pipelines and pipeline facilities in Class 1 locations are subject to federal pipeline safety laws and therefore are within the jurisdiction of the Commission under Act 127.
