Title 5 of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 requires that every state adopt and implement an air pollution operating permit program covering all federally-defined major and certain other federally-regulated stationary sources of air pollution. Operating permits improve compliance with the regulations by clarifying what installations must do to control air pollution.The purpose of an operating permit is to identify and record the regulations that apply to regulated installations. Operating permits and their accompanying applications define existing compliance obligations rather than impose new requirements. The operating permit serves as a single document for regulators, the public, and the installation, and outlines all applicable requirements and compliance demonstrations, including monitoring, testing, record keeping and reporting practices. For information regarding constructing a new air pollution source, or modifying an existing source, please visitAir Construction Permits.**Important Update**The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency published a final rule reclassifying the Missouri portion of the St. Louis ozone nonattainment area from Moderate to Serious nonattainment for the 2015 ozone standard. On June 6, 2025, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit issued an order granting Missouri’s motion to stay the effectiveness of EPA’s final rule, which changed and added new permitting requirements. While the stay is in effect, the moderate nonattainment area permitting requirements will remain in place. For more information, please review the document below.Air Permitting Impacts of the St. Louis Ozone Reclassification to Serious NonattainmentIn This Section:Pending Air PermitsIssued Air PermitsOverviewOperating Permits OverviewOperating permits are required for any air pollution source that has the potential to emit pollutants in excess of the major source thresholds. An operating permit identifies all applicable requirements. Operating permits include information on which pollutants are being released, how much is released, and what steps, if any, that the facility is required to take to reduce the pollution.Operating permits are legally-enforceable documents written by the department. Operating permits are especially useful for businesses covered by more than one part of the Clean Air Act and additional state requirements, since information about all of a source’s air pollution is consolidated in one place.There are two types of operating permits issued by the department - Intermediate operating permits and Part 70 operating permits. Not all facilities will need an operating permit, but all facilities need to know their status and obligations. Operating permits are valid for a five year period.Operating permits are required for any installation whose potential emissions of air contaminants is at or above the major source threshold. Operating permits are intended to identify all relevant requirements that apply to the various emission units at a plant, site or facility. Operating permits can establish detailed provisions for any testing, emissions monitoring, recordkeeping or reporting that is needed to demonstrate compliance with the regulations. Operating permits are not intended to be the source of new emissions limitations or requirements. Instead, operating permits are intended to identify and state all of the existing requirements that apply to the plant, site or facility; this helps the plant manager ensure compliance with these existing requirements, since they will now be explicitly identified both for the regulated source, and for the regulatory agencies themselves. Said another way, operating permits are intended to be vehicles for defining existing compliance obligations; they are not intended to impose new limits on emissions.An operating permit expires after five years. The application to renew the operating permit must be submitted at least six months before the permit expires, though the application can be submitted as much as 18 months prior to the expiration date; once an application has been submitted and found to be complete, the “application shield” ensures that the existing operating permit will not expire in the event that the renewal permit is not issued prior to the expiration date of the existing operating permit.For information about an operating permit, contact department staff at573-751-4817. Applications for permits and renewal permits require a filing fee; no filing fee is required for applications to amend existing operating permits. Payment of the filing fee may be made by check enclosed with the application or electronically; learn more abouthow to pay by credit card.Note: This information is not meant to be a tool to determine applicable federal and state regulations for a specific situation. The method of choice should always be a thorough review of the state and federal rules and regulations.IntermediateIntermediate Operating PermitsAn Intermediate installation is a Part 70 installation that accepts voluntary, federally-enforceable limitations on production and/or emissions, type of materials combusted or processed, operating rates, or hours of operation in order to reduce the potential to emit and maintain the installation's actual emissions below major source levels. These limits may have already been taken in a construction permit or may be requested as part of the Intermediate operating permit application.Intermediate operating permits are valid for a five year term. A permit shield provides protection for the installation if it has complied with all of the conditions in the operating permit.Initial ApplicationsA complete application for an initial Intermediate operating permit must be submitted within 90 days after the installation begins operation.Renewal ApplicationsIn order to renew an Intermediate operating permit, a renewal application must be submitted. In order to qualify for an application shield, a complete application to renew the permit must be submitted at least six months prior to the expiration date of the current intermediate operating permit, but no earlier than 18 months prior to the expiration date of the current intermediate operating permit.The application forms are available under theForms and Applicationssection of our website.Other ApplicationsFor information on modifications, administrative amendments, or off-permit changes to Intermediate operating permits, please refer to theModificationstab.All applications must be submitted by mail to Air Pollution Control Program, PO Box 176, Jefferson City, MO 65102 or in person at 1659 E. Elm St, Jefferson City, MO 65101. We are not currently able to accept applications submitted by email or fax. While a filing fee is required for all initial and renewal applications, no filing fee is required for amendments to existing operating permits.

A permit shield provides protection for the installation if they have complied with all of the conditions in their operating permit.Initial ApplicationsA complete application for an initial Part 70 operating permit must be submitted within 12 months after the installation begins operation.Renewal ApplicationsIn order to renew a Part 70 operating permit, a renewal application must be submitted. In order to qualify for an application shield, a complete application to renew the permit must be submitted at least six months prior to the expiration date of the current Part 70 operating permit, but no earlier than 18 months prior to the expiration date of the current Part 70 operating permit.The application forms are available under theForms and Applicationssection of our website.Other ApplicationsFor information on significant modifications, minor modifications, administrative amendments, off-permit changes, or §502(b)(10) changes to Part 70 operating permits, please refer to theModificationstab.All applications must be submitted by mail to Air Pollution Control Program, PO Box 176, Jefferson City, MO 65102 or in person at 1659 E.

These five types of modifications are:Significant Modification - coming soonMinor Modification - coming soonAdministrative Amendment - coming soonOff-Permit Change - coming soon§502(b)(10) Change - coming soonThere are three types of modifications that an installation can request be made to its Intermediate operating permit. These three types of modifications are:Intermediate Permit Modification - coming soonAdministrative Amendment - coming soonOff-Permit Change - coming soonThese changes are initiated by the permittee in order to incorporate changes to its permit.In addition to the above changes, the Air Pollution Control Program orEnvironmental Protection Agency(EPA) may reopen the operating permit to make certain changes. For example, an operating permit may be reopened for cause if a regulation becomes applicable to the installation, and more than three years remains on the life of the permit. Another example would be if the permitting authority or EPA discovers that an applicable permit requirement has been omitted from the permit – the permit would be reopened for cause to insert the relevant applicable permit requirements.Modifications to operating permits do not require a filing fee.Draft significant modifications to Part 70 operating permits are required to go through a 30-day public notice period and a 45-day EPA review period prior to issuance. All other modifications are generally issued without public notice.Applicable Statutes:RSMo 643.050Applicable Regulations:10 CSR 10-6.065and40 CFR Part 70Note: This page does not provide guidance for modifications to Title IV (Acid Rain) permits. Modifications to Title IV (Acid Rain) permits must be made following the permit revisions procedures in 40 CFR Part 72 Subpart H.
