The program currently oversees permit compliance for 23 major discharges, approximately 70 minor discharges, and approximately 250 storm water discharges. The Pretreatment Program provides ongoing oversight of fifteen approved local pretreatment programs.In accordance with the EPA Federal and RI Pretreatment Regulations, the 15 RIDEM-approved Industrial Pretreatment Programs (see contact list here) regulate almost 200 Significant Industrial Users (SIUs) and thousands of Non-Significant Industrial Users. Over half of the state’s SIUs are subject to EPA Federal Categorical Pretreatment Standards.For more information on DEM's Industrial Pretreatment Program, please contact Heidi Travers at 401-537-4186, or atheidi.travers@dem.ri.gov.RIPDES Electronic Reporting WebpageRIPDES Permit Annual Fee Payment ServiceRIPDES Stormwater Construction General Permits (CGP) Annual Fee PaymentsNEW RIPDES Remediation General Permit (RGP)2024 Remediation General PermitPDF file, about 2mbmegabytes2024 Remediation General Permit NOI Fee FormPDF file, less than 1mbmegabytes2024 Remediation General Permit Fact SheetPDF file, about 2mbmegabytesNEW RIPDES Multi-Sector General Permit (MSGP) for Stormwater Discharge Associated with Industrial Activity2024 MSGPPDF file, about 4mbmegabytes2024 MSGP FactsheetPDF file, about 1mbmegabytes2024 MSGP Response to CommentsPDF file, less than 1mbmegabytes2024 MSGP Summary of ChangesPDF file, less than 1mbmegabytesNon-Contact Cooling Water PermitGeneral Permit for Non-Contact Cooling Water DischargesPDF file, less than 1mbmegabytesNon-Contact Cooling Water Notice of IntentPDF file, less than 1mbmegabytesNon-Contact Cooling Water NOI InstructionsPDF file, less than 1mbmegabytesNon-Contact Cooling Water Fact SheetPDF file, less than 1mbmegabytesNon-Contact Cooling Water Dilution WorksheetPDF file, less than 1mbmegabytesNon-Contact Cooling Water AuthorizationPDF file, less than 1mbmegabytesNon-Contact Cooling Water Notice of TerminationPDF file, less than 1mbmegabytesGuidance for BreweriesIndustrial Pretreatment Program Factsheet for Breweries, Wineries & DistilleriesPDF file, less than 1mbmegabytesWastewater Disposal Guidance for Breweries, Wineries & DistilleriesPDF file, less than 1mbmegabytesSolid Waste Guidance for Breweries, Wineries & DistilleriesPDF file, less than 1mbmegabytesRhode Island Outlets for Brewer Solid WastePDF file, less than 1mbmegabytesGeneral PermitsRIPDES Pesticide General Permit and FactsheetPDF file, about 2mbmegabytesNon-contact Cooling Water Permit SearchRemediation General Permit SearchKey ResourcesRIPDES Storm Water ProgramRIPDES Electronic ReportingRelated LinksEPA Region 1 NPDES New EnglandEPA National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) Permitting ProgramNPDES permit application formsAdditional ResourcesRegulations for the Rhode Island Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (RIPDES) 250-RICR- 150-10-1RIPDES Application FormsRules and Regulations Governing the Establishment of Various Fees (250-RICR-30-00-1)Rules Related to Electronic Document Submissions (250-RICR-30-00-2)Listing of RIPDES Individual permits, General Permits, and TerminationsRIPDES 7Q10 policyPDF file, less than 1mbmegabytesRIPDES DMR InstructionsPDF file, less than 1mbmegabytesRIPDES Individual Permit General RequirementsPDF file, less than 1mbmegabytesRIPDES Application Fee Form for New DischargersPDF file, less than 1mbmegabytesStay InformedFollow us on social media!Online Service CenterFind online records and permits, pay service fees, and more.DEM Data & MapsView data visualizations and explore interactive maps.Stay Informed - RI WatershedsSubscribe to the RI Watersheds Information Exchange:This voluntary email list is used to share ideas and provide information on watershed management, water quality, aquatic habitat, and wetland issues in Rhode Island.Subscribe hereFor questions or help subscribing:watersheds@listserve.ri.gov.OWR Permit Application Portal Now AvailableDEM's Office of Water Resources (OWR) Groundwater and Freshwater Protection Programs have launched a new online system for permits and applications forFreshwater Wetlands, OWTS/Septic, RIPDES Construction General Permit, Water Quality Certification, and Underground Injection Control Programs.Download user guides and read updated FAQsAccess the OWR Portal LoginContact Office of Water Resources235 Promenade StreetProvidence, RI 02908-5767Phone:(401) 222-3961DEM.WaterResources@dem.ri.gov
