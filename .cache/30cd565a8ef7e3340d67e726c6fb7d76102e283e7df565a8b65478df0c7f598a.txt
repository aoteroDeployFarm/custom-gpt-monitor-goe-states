Be willing to adjust your project. On occasion, minor changes in layout can avoid disagreements and delays and, in some cases, eliminate the need for a permit.Applicants proposing complex, multi-residential, commercial, or industrial projects are strongly encouraged to schedule a pre-application conference. This meeting with DEC allows the applicant to clarify project objectives and obtain DEC's recommendations. Such feedback can improve the project environmentally and shorten the application procedure.Schedule a pre-application conference by contacting the appropriateregional DEC officeand asking for theregional permit administratorin the Division of Environmental Permits, or the regional water engineer in the Division of Water.NOTE: DEC has authorized Nassau and Suffolk Counties to administer SPDES permits for discharges to groundwaters from private/commercial/institutional facilities and for some industrial facilities.

This law specifies that any such corporation must be approved by both the local governing body (town, city, or village board, etc.) and the department of health (state, county, or city) having jurisdiction in that area. The corporation must be registered with the Department of State, and a performance bond must be posted with the local governing body.Homeowners associations and owners of condominiums often fall into this category of needing to form a sewage works corporation. A pre-application conference can help determine if such a corporation is needed.2.

(A photocopy of a USGS topographic map or equivalent, with the project site marked, will usually be sufficient.)3. A general site plan with a scale of 1"= 50' that shows the property to be affected by the project, and the location of the wastewater treatment facilities to be built in relation to natural landforms (hills, creeks, wetlands, etc.) The site plan should show:Location of buildings.Water wells on the property or adjacent properties.Location of septic systems on adjacent properties.Discharge lines and sewage outflow locations.Topography of the area at a contour interval prescribed by the region.Property lines.4.
