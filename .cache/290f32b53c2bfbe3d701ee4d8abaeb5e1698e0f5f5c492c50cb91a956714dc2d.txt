NSR is a pre-construction program which means that the entire process, resulting in an Order of Approval, must be completed before construction begins.Check the Washington Administrative Code requirements for aNew Source ReviewThere are several steps to the process of acquiring a Notice of Construction approval.Meeting with Benton Clean Air AgencyA pre-proposal meeting with the BCAA is a good way to start. At this meeting we can learn about your project and provide guidance as to what regulations would apply, and how to meet them. BCAA can provide guidance and information on how to determine potential emissions, and how to best mitigate them.SEPA ProcessWashington State policy that requires state and local agencies to consider the likely environmental consequences of a proposal before approving or denying the proposal. Benton Clean Air is not usually the SEPA lead in a project, generally the county or one of the cities takes that role. Please don’t hesitate to contact us for guidance on your SEPA applications.First, a SEPA Checklist and a Determination of Non-Significance (DNS) are required before the BCAA can allow the facility to operate. This is a state requirement on the BCAA. Generally, other agencies, such as the county or cities, will have already issued a DNS for a project. If not, then the BCAA can issue a DNS.  Usually if a DNS does not exist, the process will take a minimum of fourteen (14) days to issue the DNS. Facilities should plan for this potential delay.SEPA HandbookSEPA ChecklistNOC ProcessOnce the DNS is in place, the owner or operator of the facility next files a Notice of Construction, or NOC, application to the BCAA. The most common facility operations have forms specific to the operation; facilities that are not specifically listed can use the “General NOC” form.Air Operating PermitsHorn Rapids Landfill Statement of BasisHorn Rapids Landfill Title 5 PermitNorthwest Pipeline Statement of BasisNorthwest Pipeline Title 5 PermitNutrien Statement of BasisNutrien US LLC Title 5 PermitNOC General FormsChange of OwnershipReport of ClosurePortable FacilitiesAsphalt Plant-PortableConcrete Plant-PortableGeneral Info-PortableGenerator-PortableRock Crusher RelocationRock Crusher-PortableStationary FacilitiesAsphalt Plant-StationaryBaghouseBoiler-StationaryConcrete Plant-StationaryDry CleaningFlareGas StationGeneral OperationsGenerator-StationaryIncineratorLithographic PrintingPaint BoothRock Crusher-StationaryInformation that should be submitted with an applicationThe application should be submitted on the Notice of Construction and Application for Approval form provided by Benton Clean Air. The application should describe the air contaminant source, any connected equipment, and be accompanied by:completed and signed formsa set of plans that fully describes the proposed source, including distance and height of buildings within 200 feet of the source,the estimated emissions that will result from the proposal, or sufficient information for Benton Clean Air to calculate the expected emissions,the proposed means for control of emissions,the base fee, anda SEPA checklist or DNS (see above)After the NOC application has been submitted and the application fee paid, the BCAA has 30 days to review the application and to determine if it is complete. If the application is determined to be incomplete, the 30-day clock is reset. Therefore, it is in the best interest of the source that the application is complete and accurate.Once determined to be complete, the BCAA has 60 days to issue an Order of Approval (permit) to operate. Usually the process is less than 60 days, but in some cases, especially in unusual or complicated facilities, the process may last longer.
