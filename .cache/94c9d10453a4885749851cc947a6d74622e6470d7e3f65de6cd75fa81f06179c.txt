Pipeline SafetyTopics:Natural gas pipelinesPipeline safetyFederal authority and IUC jurisdictionPipeline safety laws fall under federal authority in Title 49, United States Code, chapter 601, Safety.Title 49 creates the framework for promoting safety of interstate pipeline facilities under federal authority. States are delegated all or part of the responsibility for intrastate pipeline facilities through an annual certification or agreement.The law empowers the IUC to obtain certification from the federal government to regulate gas pipeline safety for intrastate natural gas operators.IUC's Safety and Engineering staff enforce pipeline safety rules at 49 CFR parts 191, 192, 193, and 199, and state regulations at 199 Iowa Administrative Codechapter 10, Intrastate Gas and Underground Gas Storageandchapter 19, Service Supplied by Gas Utilities.IUC Safety & Engineering staff inspect:63 natural gas distribution system operators1 LPG distribution system operator34 intrastate pipeline operators5 interstate natural gas transmission pipeline operatorsInspections ensure that gas operators are in compliance with federal and state pipeline safety standards. The IUC  works closely with the U.S. Department of TransportationPipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration's State Programs(PHMSA) to ensure pipelines are safely operated and maintained.Transportation of natural gasThe safest way to transport natural gas is through pipelines. As long as natural gas flows through a closed controlled system, it remains a safe product. If the gas escapes from a pipeline, it has the potential to be a hazard to life, property, and the environment.Many factors contribute to pipeline failures. Federal data indicates that "outside force" damage is the largest single specified cause of all pipeline accidents. Outside force damage generally occurs when someone is digging or excavating near the pipeline.Other causes of pipeline accidents and incidents are categorized and include:construction errorsmaterial defectspipeline corrosion, both internal and externaloperator error (incorrect operation by operator personnel)malfunction of control systems or relief equipmentContacting Iowa One CallTo avoid a potential pipeline accident caused by excavation and to comply with Iowa's One Call law, a homeowner or excavator must go online toIowaOneCall.comor call 811 or 800-292-8989 to schedule underground utility lines to be located and marked. This will create a ticket for the location to be visited.The request should be made at least two days before starting any digging or excavating project, excluding Saturday, Sunday and legal holidays. Iowa One Call is a free service.Iowa One Call manages:underground location servicedamage preventionOne Call complaintsviolation enforcement by the Office of theAttorney GeneralAfter you contact Iowa One Call, the following will happen:Operators with underground facilities in the area where the excavation is planned will be notified. This includes natural gas and power utilities, communications companies, and cities and towns.Within 48 hours after being contacted, utilities will either mark their underground facilities with color-coded paint marks or flags, or tell the excavator they have no lines in the area.Filing One Call complaintsNeed to file a One Call complaint?
