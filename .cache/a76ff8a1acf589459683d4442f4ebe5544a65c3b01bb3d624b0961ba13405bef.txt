Sovereign Lands
Upon statehood in 1864, title to the bed and banks of navigable water bodies passed from the federal government to the new state. It’s important to note that there are currently a limited number of sovereign lands that the state claims; not all of Nevada’s lakes and rivers are considered state owned.

345,000
Acres
Our agency holds title and land interests, such as easements and water rights, on behalf of the state. These acres represent less than 1% of the total land area of Nevada. We acquire land needed for state use, whether it’s land for a new DMV, a veteran’s facility or a state park. Once acquired, we assign the day-to-day management of these lands to other state agencies. Whether you are a state agency employee or a member of the public, we are here to help answer any questions you may have about state lands.

Introduction/State Lands Overview
State Lands provides the expertise to acquire and hold lands for the State of Nevada. But we don’t simply hold titles; we collaborate with private businesses, citizens, federal- and state-based agencies to effectively and responsibly use the resources our state has to offer. Above all, we believe in public service and the importance of being thoughtful and responsible with our Nevada landscape.
