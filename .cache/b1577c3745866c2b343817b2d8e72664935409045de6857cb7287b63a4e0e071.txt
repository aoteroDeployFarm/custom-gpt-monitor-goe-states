These plans must include information about how the operator will respond to various emergencies, including the personnel and equipment available, shutdown procedures, notification of fire, police and other public officials, and service restoration.Each operator MUST also establish and maintain a liaison with the appropriate public safety answering point (i.e., 9-1-1 emergency call center) where direct access to a 9-1-1 emergency call center is available from the location of the pipeline, as well as fire, police, and other public officials.Below is a link to a presentation by the Pipeline Safety Division that includes additional guidance on applicable regulations such as49 C.F.R. 192.615,49 C.F.R. 192.616, and American Petroleum Institute's Recommended Practice 1162.Download the presentationIndiana 811 Law TrainingFind information about mandatory training, as recommended by the Underground Plant Protection Advisory Committee, as well as voluntary training opportunities.Learn moreUnderground Plant Protection AccountThe Underground Plant Protection Account (UPPA) fund works to reduce underground facility damages by supporting awareness, education, training, and incentive programs.Learn moreDamage to Underground FacilitiesTo report damage to an underground facility, respond to a damage case, and find cases to be heard at the next Underground Plant Protection Advisory Committee meeting, click the link below.Learn moreRules & RegulationsThe Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act of 1968 established the federal pipeline safety program and led to national safety standards for the transportation of natural gas. The law also established procedures under which states could assume the responsibility for the regulation and enforcement of these standards for intrastate pipelines under a certified agreement with the U.S. Department of Transportation’s Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA). To participate in the program, states must adopt the minimum federal safety standards; however, they can always pass more stringent state regulations.In 1971, the Indiana General Assembly created the Commission’s Pipeline Safety Division to serve as the state’s pipeline safety authority. The Division operates in partnership with PHMSA under acertification agreementand receives its authority under state law, specifically Ind. Code chapter 8-1-22.5, to conduct inspections, investigate incidents, and enforce state and federal safety regulations over intrastate pipelines.The Division is also responsible forinvestigatingalleged violations of Indiana's 811 law (Indiana Code chapter 8-1-26) and reporting its findings to the Underground Plant Protection Advisory Committee. Ultimately, the Division's mission is to ensure the safe and reliable operation of Indiana’s intrastate pipeline transportation system.The Commission has jurisdiction over 86 intrastate natural gas pipeline operators, and below are the applicable state and federal pipeline regulations, which are designed to assure safety in design, construction, inspection, testing, operation and maintenance of pipelines. It’s important to note that while there has been an increase in “emerging" pipeline commodities nationwide, such as carbon dioxide, hydrogen blends, and sustainable aviation fuel, the Commission’s Pipeline Safety Division does not have jurisdiction (including for safety and siting) and does not have any pipelines transporting these specific commodities as of 2024.For questions regarding these and other pipeline safety regulations, contact the Division using the link below.Contact usFederal JurisdictionPHMSA has jurisdiction over allinterstatepipeline operators.

Those customers who will be most seriously affected by the interruption shall, so far as possible, be notified in advance.Email the DivisionSignificant Construction ReportsEach operator must submit to the Division notification of construction that is significant to the operator, in a manner that facilitates unannounced inspections. Examples may include:new construction, replacement, or relocation of a jurisdictional:gas pipeline facility that is considered transmission by definition under 49 CFR 192.3;gas distribution main of a significant footage for a single project, including a cast iron or bare steel replacement project of any length;gas purchase point, regardless of number of customers served;gas distribution center station that is designed to serve at least 1,000 customers immediately or in the future; orhazardous liquid or carbon dioxide facility; orsignificant gas service replacement project that encompasses at least 12 city blocks or 250 services for a single project.The notification required under this requirement must include the following:A description and location of work.The type of facility.The estimated start date.The name and address of the reporting company.The name, address, and telephone number of the person to be contacted concerning the project.All other significant information concerning the project.Email the DivisionSafety Related Condition ReportsOperators must submit to the Division other reports as may be required by the Division that are relevant to the safe operation of the operator's system, including the following:Safety related condition reports as required by49 CFR 191.25.Safety related condition reports as required by49 CFR 195.56.Email the DivisionLeak DetectionFederal and state pipeline safety standards require natural gas pipeline operators to systematically patrol and survey all their transmission and distribution pipelines. These patrols and surveys are to be completed at prescribed intervals, which vary depending on specific environmental conditions or circumstances (e.g., earthquakes, construction activity, or weather conditions). The goal of these patrols and surveys is to proactively identify gas leaks or hazardous conditions that can lead to a gas leak. Advances in technology have continued to improve the effectiveness of leak detection equipment. Patrols provide evidence through visual observation of the existence of leaks and potentially hazardous conditions. Surveys, on the other hand, generally require the use of leak detection equipment designed to detect the presence of natural gas.Indiana pipeline safety regulations go above and beyond federal regulations on requiring leak surveys to be conducted once each calendar year in areas of high-occupancy buildings, such as schools, churches, hospitals, apartment buildings, and commercial buildings. Pipeline safety regulations require natural gas distribution pipeline operators to ensure the gas they deliver is properly odorized.This is an important safeguard and provides additional assurances that natural gas leaks will be detected. Specific requirements are prescribed to achieve this desired odor. Whichever way it is achieved, the detection and repair of hazardous natural gas leaks are of paramount importance in the safe operations of natural gas pipeline systems.Email the DivisionInspections & InvestigationsHistorically, the Division conducts around 900-1,000 inspections days of approximately 80+ jurisdictional natural gas pipeline operators each year. Inspection types include audits of records, procedures, field inspections, and site visits on construction projects. Operator types include:DistributionGathering linesHazardous liquidLiquified Natural GasMaster meterTransmissionProbable violations identified during inspections lead to enforcement actions such as notice of violation letters, orders of corrective action, and possible monetary fines. According to Ind. Code chapter 8-1-22.5, the Commission can assess a $200,000 penalty per violation for each day that the violation persists, up to $2 million.Although federal code sets the maximum time interval for inspections to be completed, the Division seeks to meet this requirement in two ways. First, the Division follows a four-year inspection plan with inspectors to examine each distribution, transmission, gathering and hazardous liquids operator every year (to perform at least one inspection) and each master meter operator every other year. This helps to balance the workload of not just the Division but the operators as well. Secondly, the Division maintains a data-driven risk model that prioritizes pipeline operators based on relative risk. This drives the Division’s risk-based matrix which helps to ascertain if more inspections or training with an operator is needed.By design, this two-fold approach increases transparency in the inspection process while allowing the Division to evaluate an operator for risk and take proactive measures to address that risk.How to Find Pipeline Safety InvestigationsTo find investigations conducted by the Commission's Pipeline Safety Division, follow these three steps:Visit the Commission'sOnline Services Portal.Find theIndustrytab.

The gas distribution pipeline system supplies the ultimate consumer who either purchases the gas directly through a meter or by other means, such as by rents.This section includes helpful information for master meter operators on topics such as annual reporting, operator qualifications, operations and maintenance, and more.Master Meter Annual ReportOperators of a master meter system must file an annual report with the Commission's Pipeline Safety Division byMarch 15for the previous year, as required by 170 IAC 5-3-4(e)(3).

The program shall include provisions to:Identify covered tasks.Ensure through evaluation that individuals performing covered tasks are qualified.Allow individuals that are not qualified pursuant to this subpart to perform a covered task if directed and observed by an individual that is qualified (span of control).Evaluate an individual if the operator has reason to believe that the individual’s performance of a covered task contributed to an incident as defined in Part 191.Evaluate an individual if the operator has reason to believe that the individual is no longer qualified to perform a covered task.Communicate changes that affect covered tasks to individuals performing those covered tasks. As per 49 CFR 192.801, a covered task is an activity identified by the operator, that:Is performed on a pipeline facility;Is an operations or maintenance task;Is performed as a requirement of this part; andAffects the operation or integrity of the pipeline.Identify those covered tasks and the intervals at which evaluation of the individual’s qualifications is needed.Provide training, as appropriate, to ensure that individuals performing covered tasks have the necessary knowledge and skills to perform the tasks in a manner that ensures the safe operation of pipeline facilities.Notify the Pipeline Safety Division of the IURC if the operator significantly modifies the program after the state agency has verified that it complies with this section.Each operator shall maintain records that demonstrate compliance with this subpart.Qualification records shall include:Identification of qualified individual(s)Identification of the covered tasks the individual is qualified to performDate(s) of current qualificationQualification method(s)Records supporting an individual’s current qualification shall be maintained while the individual is performing the covered task. Records of prior qualification and records of individuals no longer performing covered tasks shall be retained for a period of five years.To download the Operator Qualification Inspection Form, click the link below.Download the OQ FormNotifying the Pipeline Safety DivisionTo notify the Division with any changes regarding your plan, please email:pipelineinspections@urc.in.gov.Operations & MaintenanceEvery natural gas operator must prepare and follow a manual of written procedures for conducting operations and maintenance activities and for emergency response.This manual must be reviewed and updated by the operator at intervals not exceeding 15 months, but at least one each calendar year, as required by 49 CFR 192.605(a). This regulation is augmented by the Indiana Administrative Code, 170 IAC 5-3-2(o), to include an additional paragraph (f): "The written manual required by paragraph (a) of this section, referred to as the plan in this subsection, shall ensure the safe operation of the operator's pipeline facilities. The plan shall include, by sections, the emergency, operations, and maintenance procedures for all the pipeline facilities and shall include procedures for handling abnormal operations. This plan, when submitted, becomes a regulation for the particular operator who filed it. In addition, an operator shall:submit a copy of the plan to the Division;keep records necessary to administer the plan effectively;revise the plan as:experience dictates; andexposure of the facilities and changes in operating conditions might warrant; andsubmit to the Division all subsequent revisions of the plan not later than twenty (20) days after the effective date of the changes.
