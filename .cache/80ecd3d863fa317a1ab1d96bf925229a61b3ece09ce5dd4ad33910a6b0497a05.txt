Oil and gas wells drilled within Nevada, on either private or federally managed lands, must be permitted by the Nevada Division of Minerals. The associated drilling and completion programs must be approved by the Division before either program is implemented. The Division oversees the drilling and subsequent completion operations through daily reporting to the Division by the operator, as well as inspect the wells after they are completed. The Division must also approve all maintenance and work-over operations during the life of the well, as well as the final plugging and abandonment of a well at the end of its useful life. Oil and gas production and injection information is submitted to the Division on a monthly basis, where the information is tabulated both monthly and annually.Data ResourcesNDOM Open Data SiteOil, Gas, and Geothermal Open Data Page DemoNevada Oil ProducersNevada Oil Producers List 2022Production InformationNevada Oil-Gas Drilling, Production & Federal Leases 2021Oil Production in Nevada 2021 graphicOil Production in Nevada by Producing Field 2021 spreadsheetOil and Gas MapsNevada Active Mines and Energy Producers 2019Active and Permitted Oil Wells in Nevada, June 2017Hydraulic Fracturing in NevadaFacts on the use of hydraulic fracturing in Nevada, April 2017Oil and Gas ContactDustin HolcombFluid Minerals Program Managerop: 775-684-7045 / cp: 775-721-2726dholcomb@minerals.nv.govStatute & RegulationsNRS 522NAC 522Oil and Gas LinksNBMG Oil and Gas Well InformationEPA - Region 9Spill Prevention Control and CountermeasureBLM Mineral & Land Records System Reports (MLRS)Oil and Gas Links PageOil and Gas Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)Presentations(none)Educational Materials (K-12)Oil and Gas in Nevada Activity BookDrilling For Energy 09-12 FullPacket.pdfOther Education MaterialsAML Education and OutreachK-12 Teacher MaterialsPrograms
