The application shall include an accurate legal description and a locational, dimensional, and directional sketch acceptable to the commission or a plat of survey of the land sought to be leased and such other information as the commission may require and shall further include a certified check for $50.00 which shall be deposited with the commission as evidence of the good faith of the applicant, which sum shall only be returned to an applicant who bids for but fails to secure a lease.(d) When the commission shall desire to lease state owned lands, or upon receipt of an application by any person desiring to lease any state owned lands, the commission shall make an inspection of the land sought to be leased and such geophysical and geological surveys thereof as the commission may deem necessary.
