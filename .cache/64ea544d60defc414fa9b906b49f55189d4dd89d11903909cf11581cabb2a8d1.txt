Air Discharge Permit Application Guidance and Permit Lists

When SWCAA receives an Air Discharge Permit application, a 15-day public notice is required 
	by SWCAA 400-171 (1) . 
	During the notice period, the public may request that the Permit go through a 30-day public comment period 
	before being issued, although some Applications of substantial public interest are subject to a mandatory public
	 comment period. If there is no public interest, then the Permit is issued as final. 
	If there is a public comment period, 
	 SWCAA will respond to the comments received during the comment period and then 
	make a decision on issuance of the Permit. 
	 Applications received and Permits open for public comment are listed below.  Please contact SWCAA for more 
	 information.
