Regulatory Fact Sheet: Tennessee 



The federal government establishes minimum pipeline safety standards under the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Title 49 "Transportation", Parts 190 - 199. The Office of Pipeline Safety (OPS), within the U.S. Department of Transportation, Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA), has overall regulatory responsibility for hazardous liquid and gas pipelines under its jurisdiction in the United States. 
OPS is headquartered in Washington, DC, and supported through five regional offices located in Trenton, NJ; Atlanta, GA; Kansas City, MO; Houston, TX; and Denver, CO. OPS regional directors, pipeline inspectors/investigators, and community liaisons operate from each of the five OPS regional offices.
Community Liaisons (formerly known as CATS Managers) are available to assist the public, state or local officials, and other stakeholders with inquiries concerning pipeline safety-related matters.
OPS inspects and enforces the pipeline safety regulations for interstate gas and hazardous liquid pipeline operators in Tennessee. OPS also inspects and enforces the pipeline safety regulations for intrastate hazardous liquid pipeline operators in Tennessee.
 Through certification by OPS, the state inspects and enforces the pipeline safety regulations for intrastate gas pipeline operators in Tennessee. This work is performed by Gas Pipeline Safety Division of the Tennessee Public Utility Commission.
