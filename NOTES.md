## ✅ Completed Milestones

### 🔖 Tagging & Metadata
- ✅ Added support for `tags` in `state_urls.json`
- ✅ Updated `scraper.py` to include `tags` in all output formats
- ✅ Built `auto_tag_urls.py` to infer tags via keyword matching

---

### 📊 Reporting & Dashboarding

- ✅ Aggregates tag count by state and tag
- ✅ CLI-ready and easy to rerun

---

### 📄 Output, Caching, and Hashing
- ✅ SHA256-based diff detection for each URL
- ✅ `.cache/` structure storing previous content
- ✅ `mapping.json` file tracking hash ➝ URL + state
- ✅ `lookup_hash.py` reverse-lookup CLI tool
- ✅ Clean separation of `results/`:
  - `json`, `csv`, `markdown` per state
  - `diff/`, `content/`, and date-based file naming

---

### 🔧 Baseline & Export Control
- ✅ Full `scraper.py` CLI support:
  - `--state`, `--url`, `--export`, `--only-updated`
- ✅ Git-automated `baseline_commit_all.sh`
  - Auto-commits each state after success
  - Skips completed states via `.baseline-progress.log`
  - Supports `--full` export mode
- ✅ Error-resistant file naming + slug creation
